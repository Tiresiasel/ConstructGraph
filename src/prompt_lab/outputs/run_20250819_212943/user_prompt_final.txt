# ROLE AND GOAL
You are an extremely meticulous, detail-oriented research analyst and knowledge engineer. Your sole task is to act as an information extraction engine, strictly following the provided JSON Schema to convert unstructured text from the provided academic paper into structured knowledge.

## CORE DIRECTIVES

1. **Fidelity to Source** - All information you extract must originate directly from the provided paper text. You are strictly forbidden from making inferences, guessing, or adding external knowledge. If information is not present, use `null` or an empty array `[]`
2. **Schema is Supreme** - Your output must be, and can only be, a single, valid JSON object that strictly conforms to the provided JSON Schema. Do not add any explanations, comments, or Markdown formatting outside the JSON object
3. **Comprehensive Coverage** - You must make your best effort to comprehensively scan the entire paper (from abstract to references) to ensure all required information is extracted without omission
4. **Titles and Journal Names** - For `paper_metadata.title`, extract the title verbatim exactly as it appears in the paper (preserve any prefixes/suffixes, punctuation, diacritics, and casing; do not drop or normalize anything). For `paper_metadata.journal`, extract the full official journal name exactly as shown in the paper (no abbreviations or variants; preserve punctuation and casing).
5. **DOI Formatting** - For `paper_metadata.doi`, if the DOI appears as a URL (e.g., `https://doi.org/10.1000/xyz123`), return everything after the URL scheme (remove `http://` or `https://`), e.g., `doi.org/10.1000/xyz123`. If a bare DOI string is present (e.g., `10.1000/xyz123`), return it as-is.
6. **Minimal Core Naming (Construct Term Rule)** - Always reduce construct names to their **shortest, semantically precise form**. Apply the following operations in order:
   - Remove ownership/possessives/unnecessary qualifiers (e.g., "rival's capability to contest" → `"contest capability"`, "firm's market-specific knowledge" → `"market knowledge"`)
   - Collapse multi-word phrases into minimal noun phrases (e.g., "capability to contest" → `"contest capability"`, "ability to adapt to environment" → `"environmental adaptability"`)
   - Drop redundant modifiers unless essential to meaning (e.g., "unique organizational resources" → `"resources"` unless "unique" is theoretically critical)
   - Favor compressed compound form over verbose form (e.g., "compatibility to contest" → `"contest compatibility"`, "propensity to innovate" → `"innovation propensity"`)
   - The final `term` should be **as short as possible while preserving conceptual clarity**
7. **Definition vs Measurement Separation** - `definition` must only include the **theoretical meaning** and conceptual explanation, while `measurements` must exclusively capture how the construct was measured (survey items, proxies, formulas, indices). If a passage mixes both, **split them**: theory/explanation → `definition`, operationalization → `measurements.details`. These rules apply to ALL constructs, moderators, mediators, and control variables throughout the extraction process.

## MULTI-STEP CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT PROCESS

Execute the following tasks in strict sequence to ensure the completeness and accuracy of the extraction:

## SCOPE POLICY (Layered: Core + Secondary)

- Core scope (mandatory): ONLY extract constructs, relationships, and measurements that are explicitly tied to Hypotheses/Propositions or appear in clearly labeled "Hypothesis Development"/"Proposition" sections. Each extracted item MUST include an anchoring field to identify the hypothesis/proposition (see schema additions below).
- Secondary scope (allowed, minimal):
  - Measurements for the core constructs, even if described in Methods/Measures section, as long as they can be explicitly mapped back to a core construct.
  - Results that explicitly confirm or refute a specific hypothesis/proposition (Empirical_Result) and can be linked to its identifier.
- Out of scope: Exploratory/ancillary relationships, general literature review claims, or findings that are not clearly tied to a numbered/named hypothesis/proposition or its direct development.

### Phase 1: Initial Scan & Global Classification

1. Read the entire paper to understand its overall structure and purpose.
2. Extract the top-level metadata to populate the `paper_metadata` section.
3. **Crucially, classify the `research_type`** based on its methodology. Is it `Quantitative`, `Qualitative`, `Conceptual`, `Review`, `Meta-Analysis`, or `Mixed-Methods`?
4. **Identify Replication Study**: Determine if the paper is explicitly a `Replication Study` and set the `is_replication_study` boolean accordingly.

### Phase 2: Relationship-First Identification and Construct Harvesting (Core-only)

This is the most critical phase. Your primary goal is to find all relationship claims first, as this guarantees the capture of all relevant constructs.

1. **Systematic Search for Claims**: Meticulously scan the paper, focusing on the **Hypotheses, Hypothesis Development, Propositions, and Results sections**. Identify ONLY claims that belong to a Hypothesis or Proposition (including their development) or that explicitly confirm/refute them in Results.
2. **Harvest Constructs from Claims**: For **every single relationship claim** you identify, immediately extract all the construct `term`s mentioned within that claim (e.g., the subject, object, moderators, mediators).

   **CRITICAL RULE FOR CONSTRUCT NAMES:**
   - Extract ONLY the FULL construct name, NOT abbreviations in parentheses
   - **Examples of CORRECT extraction:**
     - ✅ "organizational commitment" (NOT "organizational commitment (OC)")
     - ✅ "network constraint" (NOT "network constraint (NC)")
     - ✅ "structural holes" (NOT "structural holes (SH)")
   - **Examples of INCORRECT extraction:**
     - ❌ "organizational commitment (OC)"
     - ❌ "network constraint (NC)"
     - ❌ "structural holes (SH)"
   - **Rule**: Remove ALL parenthetical abbreviations and keep only the complete construct name
   - **Global Application**: Apply the same rule to ALL terms (constructs, moderators, mediators, controls) AND to measurement names. Examples:
     - ✅ "distance" (NOT "distance (d)")
     - ✅ "return on assets" (NOT "return on assets (ROA)")
     - ✅ "research and development intensity" (NOT "R&D intensity")

   **CRITICAL RULE FOR DETAILED EXTRACTION:**
   - **Definitions must be comprehensive**: Extract the FULL definition, not just a brief mention
   - **Context must be rich**: Include enough context so someone unfamiliar with the paper can understand the concept
   - **Examples**: If the paper provides examples, include them in the definition
   - **Operational details**: Include how the construct is operationalized or measured
   - **Boundary conditions**: Extract any limitations or conditions mentioned for the construct
   - **Measurements must be detailed**: Include complete measurement procedures, scales, formulas, and validation details

   **CRITICAL RULE FOR CONSTRUCT SELECTION:**
   - **ONLY extract theoretical constructs** that appear in propositions, hypotheses, or theoretical frameworks
   - **Include related measurements** ONLY for those constructs mentioned in hypotheses/propositions
   - **Include control variables** ONLY when they have clear theoretical justification and are explicitly tied to the hypotheses/propositions
   - **Examples of what NOT to extract**: "p-value", "sample size", standalone mathematical parameters not framed as constructs
   - **Examples of what TO extract**: "modularity", "network constraint", "structural holes", "organizational commitment"
3. **Compile a Master List (Core Anchored)**: Create a master list of all construct `term`s harvested from the core claims only. For each item, capture the hypothesis/proposition identifier when available (e.g., `H1`, `H1a`, `P2`).

### Phase 3: Construct De-duplication, Dimension Identification & Definition Search

1. **De-duplicate**: Create a unique set of construct `term`s from the master list compiled in Phase 2.
2. **Identify Dimensions**: Re-examine the paper, especially the literature review and theory sections. If the paper describes a construct (e.g., "Organizational Justice") as being composed of multiple dimensions (e.g., "Distributive Justice," "Procedural Justice"), you must capture these hierarchical links and populate the `construct_dimensions` array.
3. **Targeted Definition Search**: For **each unique term**, now go back through the paper and search for its most explicit, verbatim `definition` and `context_snippet`.

   **CRITICAL - Detailed Definition Extraction:**
   - **Definitions must be comprehensive**: Extract the FULL definition, not just a brief mention
   - **Context must be rich**: Include enough context so someone unfamiliar with the paper can understand the concept
   - **Examples**: If the paper provides examples, include them in the definition
   - **Mathematical notation**: If the construct involves mathematical formulas or parameters, extract them completely
   - **Operational details**: Include how the construct is operationalized or measured
   - **Boundary conditions**: Extract any limitations or conditions mentioned for the construct
4. **Populate Constructs Array**: Populate the `constructs` array in the final JSON with every unique term and its found definition. If a term involved in a relationship has no explicit definition, it **must** still be included in this array (its `definition` field can be `null`).

### Phase 4: In-depth, Methodology-Aware Relationship Characterization

Terminology note: throughout this section, `subject_term` and `object_term` denote the two core constructs that form the theoretical relation in a claim (A → B). They are NOT grammatical subjects/objects from a sentence. Always choose the pair of constructs that the hypothesis/proposition asserts are related, ignoring pronouns or author phrases.

Now, return to the relationship claims identified in Phase 2 and characterize them in detail.

1. **Identify General Properties**:
   - Identify the two constructs that the claim links (A and B). Map them to `subject_term` and `object_term` by theoretical direction, NOT by sentence grammar.
   - Determine the `status`: is it a `Hypothesized` claim or an `Empirical_Result`?
   - Find any `supporting_theories`, `moderators`, and `mediators`.
   - **Extract Boundary Conditions**: Extract any `boundary_conditions` the authors set for the hypothesis or finding (e.g., "only in high-tech industries").
   - **Extract Replication Outcome**: If the paper is a replication study, determine and extract the `replication_outcome` for key relationships (`Successful`, `Failed`, or `Mixed`).

2. **Branch Extraction by Evidence Type**:
   - **If the evidence is Quantitative**:
     - Set `evidence_type` to `Quantitative`.
     - Extract `effect_direction`, `non_linear_type`, `is_meta_analysis`, `is_validated_causality`.
     - Additionally, populate `causal_support_level`, `design_type`, `manipulated_variable`, and optional `causal_notes` for each specific subject→object relationship.
     - Leave qualitative fields as `null`.
     - If the paper states a relation without clear grammatical direction but implies a theoretical direction (e.g., "X increases Y"), set `subject_term = X`, `object_term = Y`.
   - **If the evidence is Qualitative**:
     - Set `evidence_type` to `Qualitative`.
     - Extract the `qualitative_finding` and `supporting_quote`.
     - Leave all quantitative fields as `null`.

   Causality assessment protocol (integrated guidance):
   - For each subject→object relationship, first determine whether the study establishes a credible counterfactual via ANY of the following:
     - A clear treatment/intervention/shock (randomized or as-if random), or an exogenous/ quasi-exogenous source of variation AND explicit counterfactual construction (e.g., control group, before–after comparison, difference-in-differences, regression discontinuity, instrumental variables, natural experiment, matching with strong identification logic).
     - Or, a simulation/ABM/structural model that explicitly manipulates the mechanism and produces counterfactual outcomes.
   - If satisfied, set `causal_support_level = "Causal"`, set `is_validated_causality = true`, and populate:
     - `design_type` (choose from the schema enum, e.g., `RCT`, `Natural_Experiment`, `IV`, `DiD`, `RD`, `Panel_FE`, `Matching`, `Regression`, `Qualitative`, `Other`, `None`).
     - `manipulated_variable` (`Subject` | `Object` | `Other` | `None`).
     - `causal_notes` with a concise explanation of the identification strategy and key assumptions (e.g., instrument relevance/exclusion, parallel trends, continuity at cutoff).
   - If the above is NOT satisfied, set `causal_support_level = "Correlational"` and `is_validated_causality = false`.
   - If the paper’s description is insufficient to decide, set `causal_support_level = "Indeterminate"` and `is_validated_causality = false`.
   - Never infer causality from wording alone; require explicit design features or counterfactual construction. Keep `evidence_type` and causality fields logically consistent.
   - Clarification on construct identification:
     - When scanning text, ignore sentence-level subjects/objects like "we", "the authors", or "this study". Always map to the underlying constructs the claim relates.
     - If a sentence contains multiple clauses, extract each distinct construct pair that corresponds to a numbered/named hypothesis/proposition.

   **STRICT RULES for Moderators and Non-linear Effects**:
   - Moderators: Only extract a variable as a moderator when the paper explicitly labels it as a moderator or clearly claims a moderating effect (e.g., "X moderates the relationship between A and B", "we test moderation by X"). Do not infer moderators from generic interaction terms unless explicitly described as moderation by the authors.
   - Non-linear Effects: Only set `effect_direction` to a non-linear category or `non_linear_type` when the paper explicitly states a form (e.g., "U-shaped", "inverted U-shaped", "S-shaped", "curvilinear with U-shape"). The mere presence of polynomial terms or curvature tests without explicit labeling must NOT be treated as non-linear.

### Phase 5: Measurement Extraction (Secondary allowed to support Core)

For constructs that are operationalized in the methodology section, extract their specific `measurement` methods ONLY if they map directly to a core-scoped construct (from Phases 2–4). Ensure explicit mapping from measurement to the construct and, when applicable, to the linked hypothesis/proposition identifier.

**CRITICAL - Comprehensive Measurement Extraction:**
- **Extract complete measurement procedures**: Include step-by-step operationalization details
- **Include measurement scales**: Extract the specific scales, questionnaires, or instruments used
- **Mathematical formulas**: If measurements involve formulas or calculations, extract them completely
- **Validation details**: Include reliability, validity, and other psychometric properties mentioned
- **Examples of items**: If the paper provides sample questionnaire items, include them
- **Scoring procedures**: Explain how responses are converted to construct scores
- **Context-specific details**: Include any industry-specific or context-specific measurement adaptations

## Theory Extraction (Core-only)

Goal:
Extract only the theories that explicitly ground the paper’s core claims. Exclude background/literature-survey theories that are not used to justify the core arguments.

Inclusion (must satisfy ALL):
- The theory is explicitly used to justify a core claim.
- The claim is anchored to one of the following (ordered by strength):
  1) Hypothesis / Proposition with identifier (e.g., H1, H1a, P2)
  2) Formal label: Theorem / Proposition / Lemma / Corollary (e.g., T1, P1, L1, C1)
  3) Model Result (e.g., “Result 1”, “We show that…”, “The model predicts that…”)
  4) Core Claim sentence (e.g., “we propose/argue/show/predict that…”, “it follows that…”, “implies that…”)
- Provide at least one textual anchor: section_header and/or a short context_snippet containing the grounding phrase (e.g., “drawing on”, “based on”, “grounded in”).
- Do NOT include theories mentioned only as prior work without being used to justify a core claim.

Strict rules:
- Name hygiene: output the full theory name only; drop parenthetical abbreviations (e.g., use “resource-based view”, not “RBV (resource-based view)”).
- Origin source: set origin_source to one of Hypothesis | Proposition | Hypothesis_Development | Results-Confirming | Theorem | Proposition_Label | Model_Result | Core_Claim
- Claims linkage: 
  - If H/P is available, set hypothesis_id (e.g., H1, H1a, P2).
  - Always set claim_id (stable id) for the core claim (e.g., H1/H1a/P2/T1/Result1/CC1). If no author label exists, generate CC1/CC2… in reading order.

## OUTPUT FORMAT

The final output MUST be a single, valid JSON object that strictly conforms to the following JSON Schema.

What happens in the aftermath of the introduction of a new status ranking? In this study, we exploit the unique empirical opportunity generated by the release of theﬁrst edi- tion of the Michelin Guide for Washington, DC, in the fall of 2016. We build on prior work on rankings as insecurity-inducing devices by suggesting that newly awarded high-status actors modify their self-presentation attributes toﬁtw i t hw h a tt h e yb e l i e v ea u d i e n c e se x p e c tf r o m the elite. Our results show that, depending on their standing prior to Michelin’se n t r y ,r e s t a u - rants acted upon different attributes of their self-presentation. Restaurants with high prior standing emphasized attributes that channeled authenticity and exclusivity, which may imply that their Michelin designation triggered operational changes. Actors with low prior standing, on the other hand, acted on descriptive attributes that did not necessarily imply operational changes and could be easily manipulated to signal their belonging among the elite. We contribute to research on status and conformity by disentangling the sources and types of conformity behaviors that newly awarded high-status actors deploy. History: Accepted by Lamar Pierce, organizations. Supplemental Material:The online appendix and data are available athttps:/ /doi.org/10.1287/mnsc. 2021.4210. Keywords: status • evaluation • conformity • difference-in-differences • gourmet cuisine Introduction Organizational scholars have devoted substantial atten- tion to the concept of status, deﬁned as the position oc- cupied by an actor in a social hierarchy (e.g., Podolny 1993 and Piazza and Castellucci2014). Created by arbit- e r sa n dc r i t i c sw h oi s s u ep u b l i cj u d g e m e n t sa n de v a l u a - tions, status hierarchies have been credited with inﬂuencing actors’performance and survival chances (Rao et al.2005,S a u d e r2006). Status brings increased visibility and informational control (Goode1978,C o l e and Singer1991,G o u l d2002)t h a tu l t i m a t e l yp r o v i d e access to resources and performance advantages (Sim- coe and Waguespack2011,S a u d e re ta l .2012). High- status ﬁrms command higher prices, face lower costs, obtain easier access to resources, and enjoy greater free- dom to deviate from norms (Podolny1993,B e n j a m i n and Podolny 1999, Phillips and Zuckerman 2001, Sauder et al.2012). Prior studies show that, once status is attributed, high-status actors automatically accrue disproportionate rewards and resources, and status po- sitions become difﬁcult to change (Gould2002,M a l t e r 2014). It, hence, comes as no surprise that these studies describe high-status actors as more willing to deviate, as the risk of diluting their status is weak (Phillips and Zuckerman2001,D u r a n da n dK r e m p2016). But is it, really? We are all familiar with stories of restaurants gaining or losing stars, premium car- makers seeing their appeal ascend or plummet, and elite schools and athletes climbing or falling in rank- ings. 1 The relative, unstable, and highly visible nature of status hierarchies has more recently been framed as a great source of insecurity for high-status actors (Sauder and Espeland2009). Correspondingly, a more recent stream of literature has started to examine sour- ces of instability in status hierarchies (Jensen and Roy 2008, Sauder and Espeland2009, Phillips et al.2013, Hahl and Zuckerman2014, Kov´acs and Sharkey2014, Hahl et al.2017, Jourdan et al.2017, Prato et al.2019). In particular, prior work has discussed at least two reasons why an actor who lands a high-status position should not be immune to status insecurity. First, the process of attaining status encourages moral compro- mises and demands an assertion of superiority (Hahl and Zuckerman2014), leading a suspicious public to perceive high-status actors as inconsiderate and inau- thentic (Hahl et al.2017, Jourdan et al.2017). Second, recent studies have argued that high-status actors are not insulated from negative evaluations (Jensen and Roy 2008,K o v´acs and Sharkey2014) and may be sub- ject to penalties for deviance (Sauder and Espeland 6925 MANAGEMENT SCIENCE Vol. 68, No. 9, September 2022, pp. 6925– 6949 ISSN 0025-1909 (print), ISSN 1526-5501 (online)http://pubsonline.informs.org/journal/mnsc 2009, Prato et al.2019). Faced with such insecurity, high-status actors have been shown to engage in com- pensatory actions aimed at resolving concerns about morality and authenticity and at recovering lost ground in the face of negative evaluations and penal- ties. In particular, prior work has discussed how high- status actors use ostensibly compensatory behaviors to counteract the tendency to “denigrate heroes” (Hahl and Zuckerman 2014); examples include lowbrow culture appreciation (Hahl et al.2017)a n d low-proﬁt arthouse investments (Jourdan et al.2017). Other research suggests that actors react to status losses by reafﬁrming their worth through mimicking high-status value attributes, such as pricing (Askin and Bothner 2016) and categories (Delmestri and Greenwood 2016, Bowers and Prato2018). In this study, we focus our attention on actors who experience a positive change to their status, examining how the insecurity pressures generated by such an in- crease in status induce them to justify and defend their newly acquired position (Correll et al.2017, Hahl et al. 2017, Wang and Jensen 2019). Studying re- sponses to status changes demands speciﬁc empirical conditions. Most prior studies have examined changes within existing status hierarchies by looking at popu- lation data that lacked a clearly stipulated counterfac- tual and/or control population to establish causality (Azoulay et al.2013). More recently, empirical work in this domain has started to employ laboratory ex- periments (Hahl and Zuckerman 2014, Hahl et al. 2017). Although crucial for identifying the causal mechanisms at play, these studies cannot provide us with real-world evidence of actors’behavior. To avoid these problems, while also overcoming identiﬁcation issues, we leverage the unique empirical opportunity of an exogenous shock in the attribution of status— namely, the release of theﬁrst edition of the Michelin Guide for Washington, DC, in the fall of 2016. This ap- proach allows us to move away from a simple discus- sion of status gains and losses, which could originate endogenously over time. Instead, the exogenous shock of Michelin’s entry allows us to observe how fo- cal actors respond to the status change, net of poten- tial actions taken by actors to inﬂuence their status positions. Although not easy to observe, exogenous status shocks are not uncommon. Bowers and Prato (2018), for example, leveraged one of these events to study the effects of changes in status hierarchies amongﬁ- nancial analysts. In our case, Michelin is the most prestigious critic in the restaurant industry (Rao et al. 2003, 2005; Ferguson2008), and the release of its sig- nature red Guide is a signiﬁcant event for the U.S. ﬁne-dining scene. Washington, DC, was indeed only the fourth U.S. city to be acknowledged by Michelin as worthy of their attention. Such exclusivity clearly exacerbated insecurity pressures associated with the es- tablishment of a new status hierarchy, as all restaurants included in the Guide were admitted for theﬁrst time to a ranking that allowed them to join an avant-garde of national restaurants and the elite of the industry world- wide. Using a difference-in-differences approach, we examine changes enacted by restaurants included in the Guide vis-`a-vis similar DC restaurants that failed to be included. Arguably, these restaurants were also “treated” by their exclusion, and they are potentially subject to contamination effects. We, hence, further compare the behavior of included restaurants to a second control group, consisting of similar restaurants in Boston, a comparable city that Michelin has not entered. This al- lows us to more precisely link changes in restaurants’be- havior to the status shock they experienced as the result of a new, inﬂuential hierarchy being introduced. Beyond making a fundamental empirical contribu- tion to the literature on status, this work extends cur- rent theory in new and important ways. We focus our attention on the behavior of actors who experience a sudden and positive increase in status— that is, a posi- tive status shock— that elevates them to the elite of the industry worldwide. As such, it may seem they would not need to engage in compensatory actions to justify and defend their newly acquired positions. Still, we argue, these high-status actors will respond to a posi- tive status shock by modifying their self-presentation attributes to conform to the expectations associated with their newly acquired status. Our results show that restaurants that experienced a positive status shock acted on three sets of self-presentation attrib- utes. They modiﬁed the content of their menus to make their descriptive attributes consistent with the ethos of the elite. They better emphasized the techni- ques and ingredients used to display theauthenticity that characterizes elite players. Finally, they adjusted pricing to signal awareness of thevalue they create for, and capture from, their customers. We further discuss how responses to status gains are not homogeneous across high-status actors. Results from our analyses suggest that, although all of the status-shocked restau- rants acted on all three sets of attributes, the tendency to act was stronger for restaurants that were not placed at the top of the new ranking— that is, those that were not awarded a Michelin star. Contrary to our predictions, our results also suggest that restau- rants with high prior standing— which should have been less concerned about proving their worth, but are potentially subject to the denigrating tendencies de- scribed by Hahl and colleagues (Hahl and Zuckerman 2014,H a h le ta l .2017)— also engaged in substantial changes to their self-presentation. In particular, they emphasized attributes channeling authenticity and val- ue, implying that their new Michelin designation may have triggered operational changes. Restaurants with Favaron, Di Stefano, and Durand:Organizational Responses to Status Shocks 6926 Management Science, 2022, vol. 68, no. 9, pp. 6925–6949, © 2022 INFORMS low prior standing, on the other hand, mostly acted on descriptive attributes that did not necessarily imply op- erational changes, but signaled that they “ﬁtt h e mold”— that is, that they belong to the elite (Askin and Bothner 2016). Overall, we believe this work comple- ments prior studies on status insecurity and conformity by showing that high-status actors may conform to differ- ent pressures depending on the source(s) of their status insecurity— that is, on whether their insecurity originates from concerns about authenticity or belonging. Theoretical Development Higher status brings several advantages to actors. Pri- or literature has associated status with the ability to charge higher prices and generate higher revenues (Benjamin and Podolny1999); to more easily access resources and, as a result, lower costs (Podolny1993, Phillips and Zuckerman2001); and to enjoy a higher likelihood of survival in general (Baum and Oliver 1992, Podolny et al.1996, Park and Podolny2000). It should, hence, come as no surprise that organizations actively seek status, and, once they gain it, they en- deavor to capture all of the associated beneﬁts (Benja- min and Podolny 1999). Most of prior work has looked at status as a relatively stable property of actors (Washington and Zajac 2005). This stability enables high-status actors to act against general expecta- tions (Phillips and Zuckerman2001, Durand and Kremp 2016) and span categories without experiencing punish- ment (Kov´acs and Johnson2014,G o l d b e r ge ta l .2016). Scholars have more recently started to question these assumptions and embrace a more nuanced view of status. As Sauder and Espeland (2009, pp. 74–75) observe, the same processes by which actors are placed in a status hierarchy are also“engines of status anxiety,” with “perennial” insecurity fostered by the fact that status hierarchies are relative, unstable, and highly visible. Accordingly, recent work examines how actors behave when facing insecurity about their position in a status hierarchy (Askin and Bothner 2016) and the denigrating tendencies associated with status attainment (Hahl and Zuckerman2014). These studies show that actors react to status losses by signaling that they belong in the high-status group (Askin and Bothner 2016) and that they address doubts about theirﬁt by engaging in acts of deference (Jourdan et al.2017). When status is not questioned, but authenticity is, they tend to publicly display ap- preciation for authentic products and practices (Hahl et al.2017). We contribute to this line of work by un- covering how actors react to gaining status. How Actors React to Gaining Status If one were to adopt the traditional view of status as a relatively stable property that shields actors from negative evaluations and penalties, one may think that actors who suddenlygain status would feel no need to engage in actions aimed at signaling their worth. However, once we embrace the more recent and nuanced view of status, it follows that suddenly gaining status can trigger insecurity pressures, lead- ing some actors to justify and defend their newly ac- quired positions (Correll et al.2017, Hahl et al.2017, Wang and Jensen2019). That is precisely the conjec- ture our study explores. Status signals an acknowledgment of capabilities and, in turn, triggers expectations from an audience (Ridgeway and Erickson2000, Lynn et al.2009). We argue that actors newly awarded with status will in- ternalize these expectations, leading them to modify both ceremonial and material aspects of their offering to qualify as legitimate members of the elite group (Goffman 1959, Podolny 1993). An organization that reacts to a positive status shock by making changes to conform is essentially acting on its self-presentation, in an effort to better align with its perception of its audience’s expectations (Ridgeway and Erickson 2000, Schlenker 2002, Jourdan et al.2017, Wang and Jensen 2019). We, hence, reﬁne the dominant idea that high-status actors are less likely to conform to what is “normal”or observable in their industry (Phillips and Zuckerman 2001) by suggesting that they willalso dis- play a tendency to conform (Prato et al.2019). More speciﬁcally, our main hypothesis postulates that ac- tors will react to positive status shocks by modifying their self-presentation, with the aim of conforming to what they believe audiences expect from high-status players: Hypothesis 1. Organizations that experience a positive status shock will modify their self-presentation with the aim of conforming to the expectations associated with their new- ly acquired status. In our speciﬁc empirical setting, we look at how res- taurants included in the Guide modify their self- presentation by acting on their menus. Our intuition rests on the idea that restaurant menus play a funda- mental role that goes well beyond the obvious provi- sion of information about items and prices. Menus are the “ﬁrst clear opportunity for the restaurant to identify itself to the patrons and give an indication about what kind of establishment it is” (Lakoff 2006,p .1 5 1 )— that is, they communicate the essential nature of an estab- lishment. Indeed, there is increasing emphasis in the restaurant industry on the science behind“menu engi- neering,” 2 a topic that may sound obscure to us as restaurant customers, but that is nowadays part of the curriculum taught to industry professionals. 3 Fine- dining menus may use sophisticated names for each dish. They often provide details about ingredient sourc- ing or the story behind the creation of the dish itself Favaron, Di Stefano, and Durand:Organizational Responses to Status Shocks Management Science, 2022, vol. 68, no. 9, pp. 6925–6949, © 2022 INFORMS 6927 (see Figure1 for an example). These choices help a res- taurant set expectations with customers, and, as noted by Liberman (2004), they are used as status markers— tangible manifestations of the standing of the establish- ment. Viewing menus as a tangible manifestation of restaurants’efforts to mark their status is also practical from an empirical standpoint, as it allows us to com- pare changes within and across organizations (Rao et al. 2003). If menus can be used as markers of status, we suggest that restaurants will act to ensure that their Figure 1.Example of Menu Notes. The ﬁgure displays an example of a restaurant menu. Prior work suggests that high-status restaurants tend to offer a high level of detail in their menus to convey a narrative that goes beyond a simple list of ingredients. The menu shown further exempliﬁes how menus can be used to provide details about ingredient sourcing or the story behind the creation of the dish itself. Favaron, Di Stefano, and Durand:Organizational Responses to Status Shocks 6928 Management Science, 2022, vol. 68, no. 9, pp. 6925–6949, © 2022 INFORMS menu reﬂects their new position (Rao et al. 2005; Gergaud et al.2007, 2015) .C h a n g e si nm e n u sc a nb e used by the newly recognized high-status actors as a simple, yet powerful, way to align their self- presentation with the perceived expectations of a status-conscious audience. The Moderating Role of Prior Standing We have argued that actors make changes in their self-presentation to conform to what they believe audiences expect from high-status players and to qualify as legitimate members of the elite. In doing so, we have conceived of newly recognized high-status actors as homogenous. Still, one could expect such changes to be particularly useful when audiences’per- ceptions are not perfectly aligned with the newly granted status position (Kov´acs and Sharkey 2014). This is consistent with arguments put forward by Gergaud et al. (2015) in their study of the effects of Michelin stars in New York City. According to the authors, when a restaurant increases its prices after being featured in Michelin, its chances of survival in- crease only when itsperceived food quality (measured with consumer ratings) also goes up. In other words, producers’actions need to be aligned with audiences’ perceptions. Our argument is that the standing of an actor prior tothe shock will affect the extent to which the actor feels the need to make changes to their self- presentation. Existing theories that link organizational status with actor behavior rest on several assumptions. One of these assumptions is the perceived sense of security that comes with a status position (Berkowitz and Macaulay 1961, Bowers and Prato2018). Theory on middle-status conformity, for example, requires high- status actors to feel secure in their position before they feel free to deviate (Phillips and Zuckerman 2001, Durand and Kremp2016). Applying this to our setting, we can expect that restaurants included in the Michelin Guide had different prior standing based on evaluations from prominent local critics. Michelin in- spectors are undoubtedly the most prominent evalua- tors in the restaurant industry (Ferguson2008), and they were clearly perceived as such when Michelin entered in Washington, DC (see Methods for a de- scription). Yet, local critics fromThe Washington Post and Washingtonian magazine, among others, had been issuing reviews and ratings that arguably contributed to the standing of DC restaurants long before Michel- in came to town. We would expect organizations that enjoyed high standing prior to a positive status shock to beneﬁt from a heightened sense of security, in turn, receiving a positive status shock as an afﬁrmation of an existing standing rather than as a change requiring adaptation. Thus, we predict that, in line with prior work, these organizations will feel less pressure to mark their newly acquired position (Kim and Jensen 2011, Durand and Kremp2016) and will be less likely to modify their self-presentation: Hypothesis 2. Organizations with high standing prior to a positive status shock will be less likely to modify their self- presentation in response to that shock. Methods Setting and Data We test our theory in the context ofﬁne dining, a pop- ular context of enquiry for organization studies (Rao et al.2003, 2005; Demetry2013; Di Stefano et al.2014; Kov´acs and Johnson2014; Di Stefano et al.2015). On May 31, 2016, Michael Ellis, director of the Michelin Guide, announced that theﬁrst edition of the Wash- ington, DC, Michelin Guide would be published in the fall of that year.4 According to Michelin, the new Guide would“put the city moreﬁrmly on the world stage of great gastronomic destinations.” Press inter- views released by prominent chefs, and our own in- terviews with food critics and restaurant managers in the weeks following the announcement, substantially conﬁrmed Michelin’s expectations. 5 “I expect it will change consumers’expectations (about the culinary scene in DC); the Michelin Guide is so highly revered” was theﬁrst comment we received from the owner of a midrange restaurant in downtown DC. Another in- formant explained, “When a new review (or award) comes out, we tend to have an upsurge of people who are dining with us because of that, and so of course, we respect that they have a particular expectation.” Similarly, the manager of another restaurant com- mented, “It is a signiﬁcant standard for dining and so for DC to be included for theﬁrst time is a big deal.” With the Guide’s publication on October 13, 2016, Washington, DC, became only the fourth U.S. city af- ter New York, San Francisco, and Chicago to have a Michelin Guide. The publication was clearly expected to elevate the status of the city’s dining scene, which, at the time, suffered from“an outdated reputation of offering only fusty steakhouses.” 6 Only 106 of the city’s restaurants were ultimately treated by inclusion in the Michelin Guide, with 12 be- ing awarded a coveted Michelin star. The release of the Guide drew a clear line between restaurants that were included in the Guide and those that were not included, dividing aﬁeld of potential contenders that would have previously appeared similar based on fac- tors such as local ratings, price point, and cuisine style. We will refer to this second group of restaurants as those that were“at risk” of making it to the Guide, but were, in fact, excluded by Michelin inspectors. Fo- cusing our attention only on restaurants in the DC area, however, may not sufﬁce, because, to some ex- tent, the entire city was treated by Michelin’s entry. Favaron, Di Stefano, and Durand:Organizational Responses to Status Shocks Management Science, 2022, vol. 68, no. 9, pp. 6925–6949, © 2022 INFORMS 6929 To mitigate this threat to identiﬁcation, we created a matched sample of restaurants in a city that was com- parable in geography, size, and dining scene, but in which the Michelin Guide was not present. We ex- plain our empirical strategy next. Empirical Strategy Given our interest in studying the effects of Michelin’s entry on the behavior of restaurants included in the Guide, our empirical strategy relies on a difference-in- differences (DID) framework, in which we compare treated restaurants in the Guide with two meaningful control groups: (1) restaurantswithin DC that were at risk of entering and (2) restaurantsoutside DC that were located in a comparable city (Boston) where Mi- chelin did not enter.7 The rationale behind the use of two control groups is that arguably all DC restaurants were treated by the entry of Michelin. (That is, it could be said that restaurants at risk of entering were treated with exclusion from the Guide.) Also, we cannot ex- clude contamination effects due to competition. The use of the second control group allows us to more precisely link changes in restaurants ’ behavior to the status shock they experienced. For our analyses, we build on the classic DID estimator (Wooldridge 2010): Y it /equals b0 + b1 ∗ dt Post + b2 ∗ di Treat + b3 ∗ dt Post ∗ di Treat + ai + ct + uit,( 1 ) in which Yit is our dependent variable for restauranti in year t,d t Post is a dummy variable indicating whether the observation occurs post-publication or pre-publication of the Guide, and di Treat is a dummy variable indi- cating whether the restaurant is in the treated or control group. The term of interest in the above equation is the interaction between the two dum- mies for post-publication and treated (in bold). The coefﬁcient ( b 3) captures how restaurants in the treated group reacted to Michelin’s entry compared with restaurants in the control group. Control Group Within DC.Our ﬁrst control group con- sists of DC restaurants that were excluded from the ﬁrst edition of the Michelin Guide, despite being simi- lar on a number of visible parameters to those that were included. To build this control group, we started with more than 700 restaurants that were excluded from the Guide and for which we had complete infor- mation (name, location, cuisine type, price range, rat- ings, reviews, and menus) before and after Michelin’s entry. Next, we analyzed common features of restau- rants included in the Guide and decided to keep only restaurants with the following features: (1) a Yelp rat- ing equal to or above the lowest of all Yelp ratings of restaurants included in the Guide; (2) a price range equal to or above the restaurant with the lowest price range in the Guide; and (3) a cuisine type common to at least two other restaurants in the Guide. The result- ing list of 143 restaurants composes our ﬁrst con- trol group. It is important to highlight that our objective with this control group was not to create an exact match to the 83 treated restaurants. 8 Although an exact match would have been empirically ideal, it would not have made sense from a practical standpoint, given that, with few exceptions,9 all restaurants usually consid- ered the best in town were actually included in the Guide. We, hence, opted for a more inclusive list that represented the set of all other DC restaurants meet- ing the minimum requirements for inclusion in the Guide. Control Group Outside DC.We built our second con- trol group by identifying restaurants located in a city that was comparable to DC in terms of geography and dining scene, but that was not covered by Michelin. The city of Boston proved to be the ideal candidate.10 We identiﬁed control restaurants through a matched case-control approach based on the following set of pre-Guide covariates: (1) cuisine type, (2) price level, and (3) average Yelp rating. For each treated restau- rant, we identiﬁed all exact matches based on cuisine type and price. This resulted in a set of potential matches, among which we picked the one whose aver- age Yelp rating pre-Guide was within a60.5 range of the rating of the original restaurant. If this procedure still resulted in more than one match, we randomly se- lected one. We report the complete list of restaurants in our treated and control groups in Online Appendix 1, while Figure2 s h o w st h e i re x a c tl o c a t i o no nt h em a p . As shown in Table1, matching between the treated group and the control group outside DC (control 2) was very effective on all relevant dimensions, with the only difference being in restaurant age (higher for control). On the other hand, the comparison between the treated group and the control group within DC (control 1) revealed signiﬁcant differences in the aver- age Yelp rating and price level (lower for control). This ﬁnding can be explained by the fact that control 1 is not an exact match, but was, rather, designed to keep track of the behavior of all restaurants potential- ly at risk of inclusion in the Guide. In light of thisﬁnd- ing, we suggest extreme caution in formulating con- clusions that are not supported by a comparison with control 2. Note that our identiﬁcation strategy rests on the idea that some restaurants in Washington, DC, were treated with their inclusion in the Guide, whereas others— either in the same city (control 1) or in a Favaron, Di Stefano, and Durand:Organizational Responses to Status Shocks 6930 Management Science, 2022, vol. 68, no. 9, pp. 6925–6949, © 2022 INFORMS comparable city (control 2)— were not, and, hence, the control groups can act as a counterfactual to what we observe happening in the treatment group. For this approach to be credible, a series of conditions need to be satisﬁed, notably, the parallel trend assumption, as well as the absence of a contemporaneous event dif- ferentially affecting some restaurants or cities during our period of study. We will present evidence to check Figure 2.(Color online) Location of Treated and Control Restaurants Notes. The upper map shows the location of restaurants in Washington, DC, with pins identifying both treated restaurants (color red online) and restaurants in control 1 (color blue online). The lower map shows the location of restaurants in Boston, with pins identifying restaurants in con- trol 2. Two restaurants in control 1 (nos. 78 and 83; see Online Appendix 1) were included, despite being located outside Washington, DC, be- cause of their frequent inclusion in local dining guides. These two restaurants are not visualized in the map due to scale constraints.

Variables and Measures Our data collection began immediately after the announcement of the Guide’s ﬁrst Washington, DC, edition (May 31, 2016). In the time frame between the announcement and the actual publication of the Guide (October 13, 2016), while still ignorant about which restaurants would be included in the Guide, we col- lected information about restaurants in Washington, DC, and Boston from Yelp. Information for each res- taurant included name, location, cuisine type, price range, ratings, reviews, and menus, when available. When menus were not available on Yelp, we searched restaurant websites. This procedure allowed us to compile a list of more than 1,500 restaurants located in Washington, DC, and Boston. Between June and Sep- tember 2017 (approximately one year after theﬁrst data collection and before the publication of the sec- ond edition of the Guide), we conducted a new data collection on Yelp (and on restaurant websites when menus were not available through Yelp). We use the shock triggered by Michelin’s entry to examine the be- havior of restaurants that were included in the Guide vis-`a-vis the two control groups, which we built fol- lowing the procedure described in the previous sec- tion. We describe all variables and measures in Table 2 and report descriptive statistics and correlations in Table 3. Our main independent variable is the interaction between two dummies, namely,postpublication (equal to one after the publication of the Guide and zero be- fore) andtreated (equal to one for treated restaurants and zero for control). We captured restaurants’reac- tions by looking at how restaurants modiﬁed attrib- utes of their dinner menus. In order to determine which changes a restaurant would implement, we built on previous work in the areas of linguistics, taste, and culture by looking at the evolution of res- taurant menus in the United States (Zwicky and Zwicky 1980, Liberman 2004, Lakoff 2006, Jurafsky 2014, Jurafsky et al.2016). The study by Jurafsky et al. (2016), in particular, offers key insights on the charac- teristics of restaurant menus. The authors carefully an- alyzed the menus of 6,511 restaurants in seven U.S. cities (including Washington, DC) and the 591,980 dishes included in those menus. The results of this study, summarized in their James Beardﬁnalist book and featured, among others, byThe New York Times, The Boston Globe,a n dThe Financial Times, offer a rich overview of the distinctive features and trends of res- taurant menus. We leveraged this work to identify six relevant attributes in the menus in our sample. The ﬁrst two attributes we examined are associated with how menus look from adescriptive standpoint, in terms of the number of words used to describe menu items and explicit references to portion sizes. Prior work suggests that high-status restaurants tend to of- fer a high level of detail in their menus to convey a narrative that goes beyond a simple list of ingredients (as exempliﬁed by the case displayed in Figure1). We use description lengthto capture the level of detail pro- vided in menus. The variable is measured as the num- ber of words used in the menu, divided by number of dishes in the menu, to facilitate comparison across menus. 11 Moreover, according to prior work, high- and low-status restaurants differ from one another in that the latter are more concerned with giving an im- pression of abundance and, therefore, highlight the size of portions. Our second variable,size description, is a direct translation of Bourdieu’s( 1984)d eﬁnition of plenty. In particular, we look at the number of words (divided by the number of dishes) used to char- acterize the size of portions, using the list compiled by Jurafsky (2014). The next two attributes we examined are associated with howauthentic menus look, as exempliﬁed by the emphasis on mastery of culinary skills and the origin of ingredients. Prior work suggests that high-status restaurants tend to differ from low-status ones in terms of quality of raw materials and level of culinary skills used in the preparation of dishes (Rao et al. 2005). Ourﬁrst variable,craft authenticity, captures the Table 1.

Our second variable,nat- ural authenticity, focuses on raw materials (Lakoff 2006) by measuring the number of words (divided by number of dishes) related to the provenance and ori- gin of food, using the list compiled by Jurafsky (2014). 12 The last two attributes we examined are associated with the value conveyed by menus, as signaled by prices. Prior work suggests that high-status actors can command higher prices (e.g., Podolny1993 and Sands 2020) and use pricing to signal belonging (Askin and Bothner 2016).13 To examine the pricing strategies of restaurants newly included in the Michelin Guide, while reducing the complexity associated with differ- ences in menu structure and dish types across cuisines (e.g., a main course in a Korean restaurant corre- sponds to different menu entries, such as bibimbap, stew, grill, etc.; in an Italian restaurant, similarly, you have aﬁrst and/or a second course after the appetiz- er), we focused on main dishes only. Ourﬁrst vari- able, average price, is the average of all dish prices Table 3. Descriptive Statistics and Correlations Variable Mean SD Min Max 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1.

Our second variable,minimum price, is the minimum of all dish prices in the main dishes (or equivalent) section o ft h em e n u ,w h e r ew ew o u l de x p e c tc h a n g e st om o s t l y capture signaling behaviors (e.g., the newly awarded restaurant raising the bar to keep pace with the elite). Because some menus in our sample did not include price information, we include variables related to value attributes for 71 of the 83 treated restaurants (and their corresponding matches in control 2) and for 133 of the 143 restaurants in control 1. Finally, we measured our moderating variable,prior standing, based on rankings and awards provided by the most prominent intermediaries before Michelin entered. Based on our understanding of the dining scene in the DC area, we identiﬁed three prominent local rankings and awards (The Washington PostDin- ing Guide, theWashingtonian 100 Very Best, and the Rammy awards by the Restaurant Association Metro- politan Washington). We also included the James Beard Awards presented by the eponymous founda- tion to recognize culinary professionals across the United States. A restaurant in our treated group re- ceived a prior standing score of one if it appeared at least once in any of these rankings in 2015 or 2016, and zero otherwise. This allowed us to identify a sub- group of 45 treated restaurants with high prior stand- ing, while the remaining 38 had low prior standing. Results The Effects of Michelin’s Entry on Restaurant Menus We start by analyzing the main effect of the shock triggered by Michelin’s entry on the behavior of res- taurants, as captured by changes in their menus. To this end, weﬁrst ran our DID models to estimate the overall effect, then dove deeper to understand the sources of these changes both at the aggregate level and at the individual restaurant level. Table4 reports the results of an ordinary least squares (OLS) regres- sion with restaurantﬁxed effects and standard errors clustered at the restaurant level. Our variable of inter- est is the interaction term betweenpostpublication and treated. We ran the analysis on all the restaurants that were included in the Guide and then distinguished between restaurants that were or were not awarded Michelin stars. Stars are an additional recognition awarded by Michelin to restaurants that offer a partic- ularly good cuisine and are considered one of the top achievements in the career of a chef (Di Stefano et al. 2015). Because only eight of the 83 restaurants in our data set are starred, we do not report the results of a regression on such a small sample; we focus instead on the results for non-starred restaurants only. Fol- lowing a middle-status conformity argument (Phillips and Zuckerman2001) applied to the context of a rar- eﬁed top, one could argue that, mutatis mutandis, non-starred restaurants represent middle-status organ- izations that can still improve their status position. In this case, we should observe that these restaurants have a higher propensity to conform compared with the broader population, which includes the starred restaurants. As shown in Table4, after Michelin’s entry, we ob- serve a signiﬁcant positive effect on the length of dish descriptions (b5 1.404, p 5 0.005 for control 1; andb 5 1.404, p 5 0.018 for control 2), emphasis on craft au- thenticity (b5 0.021, p 5 0.013; and b5 0.019, p 5 0.043), and minimum prices charged for main dishes (b5 0.777, p 5 0.024; andb5 0.779, p 5 0.059) com- pared with restaurants in both control groups and in- dependent of whether restaurants were awarded stars. These results are consistent with Hypothesis1 and the idea that organizations experiencing a posi- tive status shock will modify their self-presentation to conform with expectations associated with their new- ly acquired status. Interestingly, in the case of non- starred restaurants, we also observe a signi ﬁcant increase in emphasis on the origin of ingredients (b5 0.016, p 5 0.033; andb5 0.011, p 5 0.100) and a signif- icant decrease in the emphasis on portion sizes (only compared with control 2: b52 0.009, p 5 0.037). These results are consistent with the idea that restau- rants that were included in the Michelin Guide, but did not make it to the top, were particularly insecure in their position and, hence, felt the need to better mark their newly acquired status. 14 How Big Are the Effects?To better gauge the econom- ic signiﬁcance of these results, in Table5, we compute effect sizes and decompose the overall DID effect into (a) the effect that Michelin’s entry had on treated res- taurants and (b) the effect that Michelin’s entry had on control restaurants. The table produces a few inter- esting observations. First, across both control groups (control 1 and control 2) and both samples (all restau- rants and non-starred restaurants only), Michelin’s entry increased the difference between treated and control group restaurants by 10%–12% for the length of dish descriptions and 15%–24% for mentions of craft authenticity. Within the subgroup of non-starred restaurant, we also observe an increase of 18%–27% in mentions of natural authenticity and a 38% decrease in mentions of portion sizes, when comparing treated res- taurants to those in control 2. As for prices, we detect a signiﬁcant 5% increase in the difference in minimum prices between treated versus control restaurants in the entire sample, but not in the non-starred subgroup, Favaron, Di Stefano, and Durand:Organizational Responses to Status Shocks 6934 Management Science, 2022, vol. 68, no. 9, pp. 6925–6949, © 2022 INFORMS thus suggesting that the increase is driven by starred restaurants becoming less accessible. The effects fordescription length and minimum price are easy to interpret. The former tells us how many words, on average, are used to describe a dish on the menu; the latter tells us how many dollars are charged for a main dish, on average or at a minimum. The changes related to size description, craft authenticity, and natural authenticity, on the other hand, are more difﬁcult to put in context, as they refer to how many words related to portion sizes, cooking techniques, or ingredient provenance are used, on average, for de- scribing a dish. To help with the interpretation, it may be useful to consider that these words are not very fre- quent: In 2016, restaurants in our sample used at most approximately three words related tosize description, approximately ﬁve related tocraft authenticity, and ap- proximately three related tonatural authenticity.

Favaron, Di Stefano, and Durand:Organizational Responses to Status Shocks Management Science, 2022, vol. 68, no. 9, pp. 6925–6949, © 2022 INFORMS 6935 implies that, when we talk of a 20%–40% variation, we are talking, at best, about a one-word change in the difference between two menus. This is a small, but no- ticeable, effect: adding even a single word such as “generous,”“hearty,”“sous-vide,”“saut´e,”“organic,” or “grass-fed” to a 12-word description (on average) has been shown to dramatically affect customers’per- ceptions (Wansink et al.2002). 15 A second interesting observation that emerges from looking at Table5 is that the effects we detect with our DID estimator come from treated restaurants moving against trends that are common to control restaurants across both control groups. This is the case for all variables exceptmini- mum price, where the trends we observe for treated restaurants are in line with those we observe for con- trol restaurants, only stronger. We will come back to this evidence when discussing the assumptions be- hind our DID models. Where Do the Effects Come From?Once we estab- lished that Michelin’s entry had a signiﬁcant effect on the difference between treated and control restaurants and assessed the size of this effect, we next explored the extent to which the patterns we identify are caused by the majority of restaurants in our sample moving in this direction or a few individual restaurants driving the ef- fect. To this end: (a) We plotted all restaurants on scat- tered boxplots to examine how treated restaurants c h a n g e dp r e / p o s ta sc o m p a r e dw i t ht h e i rm a t c h e d counterparts; (b) we graphed the empirical Cumulative Distribution Function (eCDF) of the pre/post difference for treated and control restaurants; and (c) we plotted the pre/post behavior of individual restaurants using lollipop plots. Figure3 reports results related to (a) and (b) for the signiﬁcant effects detected in Table4 for all restaurants (description length, craft authenticity,a n dmini- mum price), with the rest of the analyses being reported in Online Appendix 3. Graphs in Figure3 show that most restaurants are moving in line with the signiﬁcant effects we previously identiﬁed. For description length, we observe an upward shift in the entire distribution and a decrease in the number of outliers, with opposite trends for control restaurants. Forcraft authenticityand minimum price, the interquartile range shifts toward higher values, and the maximum goes up, with oppo- site (craft authenticity)o rw e a k e r(minimum price)t r e n d s for control restaurants. The overall patterns in the eCDF are in line with our expectations, despite few negligible areas of overlap between treated and control restau- rants after the Guide’sp u b l i c a t i o n . Table 5.

Favaron, Di Stefano, and Durand:Organizational Responses to Status Shocks 6936 Management Science, 2022, vol. 68, no. 9, pp. 6925–6949, © 2022 INFORMS The Moderating Role of Prior Standing We next studied the inﬂuence of prior standing on our main effect. To this end, we ran a split-sample analysis comparing treated restaurants, with high ver- sus low prior standing, to all 143 restaurants in control 1 and to all 83 restaurants in control 2. 16 We then con- ducted post-estimation tests for the equality of coefﬁ- cients across the two speciﬁcations (i.e., low and high prior standing), while clustering the standard errors at the restaurant level. Remember that our main re- sults, as per Table4, show that, compared with control restaurants, restaurants included in the Guide experi- enced a signiﬁcant increase indescription length, craft authenticity, andminimum price. Results from our split- sample analysis, shown in Table6, seem to suggest that restaurants mark their newly acquired status po- sitions in different ways, depending on their prior standing. In particular, restaurants with low prior standing are somewhat more likely to emphasize de- scriptive attributes: They exhibit higher levels ofde- scription length(control 1:b5 1.764, p 5 0.010; control 2: b5 1.764, p 5 0.021), even if the difference with high-prior-standing restaurants is not signi ﬁcant (control 1:p 5 0.243; control 2:p 5 0.416). Restaurants with high prior standing, on the other hand, are somewhat more likely to emphasize authenticity at- tributes: They exhibit higher levels ofcraft authenticity (control 1:b5 0.029, p 5 0.016; control 2:b5 0.028, p 5 0.033), even if the difference with low-prior-stand- ing restaurants is, again, not signiﬁcant (control 1:p 5 0.222; control 2:p 5 0.172). Restaurants with high prior standing are also more likely to emphasize val- ue attributes: Theirminimum priceis higher (control 1: b5 1.317, p 5 0.005; control 2:b5 1.319, p 5 0.013), and signiﬁcantly more so compared with restaurants with low prior standing (control 1:p 5 0.049; control 2: p 5 0.049). 17 In Table7, we compute effect sizes and decompose the overall DID effect into the effect that Michelin’s entry had on treated restaurants with high prior standing, treated restaurants with low prior standing, and control restaurants. As shown in the table, the size of the effect of Michelin’s entry is larger for low- prior-standing restaurants in the case of description length (13% versus 8%–9% for high prior standing) and for high-prior-standing restaurants in the case of craft authenticity (41%–43% versus 10%–12% for low prior standing) andminimum price(8%–9% versus 1% for low prior standing). Overall, weﬁnd some support for the intuition that prior standing matters in how or- ganizations react to positive status shocks. However, contrary to our expectations, weﬁnd that prior stand- ing may actually reinforce the need to modify some self-presentation attributes. In particular, our results suggest that restaurants with high prior standing fo- cused on attributes aimed at signaling authenticity and value, whereas restaurants with low prior stand- ing mostly acted on descriptive attributes. Robustness Checks for Model Assumptions Our identiﬁcation strategy rests on the idea that some restaurants in Washington, DC, were treated with in- clusion in the Guide, whereas others— either in the same city (control 1) or in Boston (control 2)— were not and, as such, can act as a counterfactual to what we observe happening in the treatment group. For this approach to be credible, a series of conditions need to be satisﬁed. Contemporaneous Events.A ﬁrst important concern is whether another, contemporaneous event might have differentially affected some restaurants or cities during our study period. Given our empirical strategy of using two controls, one from Washington, DC, and one from Boston, and given that the comparison with both control groups yields similar results, for a con- temporaneous event to drive the results, we would need to have either (i) a contemporaneous event affecting only the treated group; or (ii) a contempora- neous event affecting the two control groups jointly. Indeed, if an event were affecting only restaurants in Washington, DC, the control group from Boston should enable us to circumvent the problem, and vice versa. In other words, one could argue that if the com- parison with both control groups yields similar re- sults, these results are not an artifact of the control we use, but are more likely to be the product of an actual difference between treated and control restaurants. This is the reason why, despite our strong preference for using the control group from Boston— a city not directly affected by Michelin’s entry— we show results from both controls. Clearly, one may argue that Boston was also affect- ed by the publication of the Guide in ways that accen- tuate the effects we observe. Our understanding, however, is that Michelin’s entry in Washington was received with a certain degree of annoyance by the Boston culinary industry, 18 given the similarity be- tween the culinary scenes of the two cities. We, hence, tried to understand whether the trends we observe among control restaurants in Washington, DC, and Boston are in line with broader industry trends. We address this question in Online Appendix 4, where we engage in a detailed examination of trends related to our outcome variables at the national level. Results from this qualitative examination, while purely de- scriptive in nature, are consistent with what we ob- serve systematically in Table5: an increased emphasis on leaner, shorter menus, with simpler dish descrip- tions. We discuss how the issue of portion sizes has been attracting a lot of attention, in particular, among casual-dining operators; that restaurants have tried to Favaron, Di Stefano, and Durand:Organizational Responses to Status Shocks Management Science, 2022, vol. 68, no. 9, pp. 6925–6949, © 2022 INFORMS 6937 address the related health concerns, but faced resis- tance among customers; and that in the years of our study, there seems to be a decline in the attention chefs paid to related topics.

Finally, with respect to prices, we look at the increase in prices wit- nessed by U.S. urban consumers (Consumer Price In- dex for all Urban consumers) between the fall of 2016 and the fall of 2017. Overall, this overview seems to indicate that restaurants in both control groups were moving in line with national and regional trends, whereas restaurants in the treatment group were ac- tively counteracting or emphasizing those dynamics. A remaining doubt one may have is whether treated restaurants were responding to another event that may have affected treated restaurants only.

Still, we tried to qualitatively address this possibility by looking at oth- er local rankings, in the attempt to understand wheth- er there was any signiﬁcant change in 2015 or 2016 that could have indicated a “targeted” additional shock to our treated restaurants. The analysis, re- ported in Online Appendix 4, is very descriptive, but shows a pattern of stability in other status rankings. This reassures us that there was no particular shake- out affecting the treated restaurants in the months preceding the Guide’s publication. Parallel Trends.A second relevant concern regards a critical assumption on which DID models rely— the parallel trend assumption— according to which the control group acts as a counterfactual by showing what would have happened to the treatment group had the treatment not been administered. From a qual- itative standpoint, the results we discussed above suggest that our control restaurants were behaving in line with more general industry trends, whereas treated restaurants were departing from those trends. The question, hence, becomes: How were treated res- taurant behaving before Michelin announced it was coming to town? This brings us to a quantitative exam- ination of the parallel trends assumption. The compli- cation with our data is that, once we learned in May 2016 that Michelin was going to be launched in Wash- ington, DC, and started collecting menus, we found it challenging to retrieve menus from before the an- nouncement. We, hence, decided to leverage web- archiving services, such as WebArchive, and transcribe photos of menus that had been published online by re- viewers. This arduous procedure allowed us to retrieve two additional menus for 25 of the 83 treated restau- rants in Washington, DC, and for 22 of the 83 control restaurants in Boston. Figure4 shows the timing of data collection for this subsample of treated and con- trol restaurants, while Table8 compares them to the population of restaurants on which we ran our main analyses, showing no signiﬁcant differences. Although the smallN does not grant sufﬁcient power for rigor- ous tests, examining these trends allows us to obtain some descriptive empirical evidence that may comple- ment the qualitative evidence presented above and dis- cussed in greater detail in Online Appendix 4.

We split treated restaurants according to whether they had high or low prior standing and compare them to the 143 restaurants at risk of inclusion from Washington, DC (control 1) and the 83 matched restaurants in Boston (control 2). Figures in bold correspond to signiﬁcant effects as per Table6. Diff, difference. Favaron, Di Stefano, and Durand:Organizational Responses to Status Shocks 6940 Management Science, 2022, vol. 68, no. 9, pp. 6925–6949, © 2022 INFORMS Remember that our main results, as per Table4, show that, compared with control restaurants, restau- rants included in the Guide experienced a signiﬁcant increase indescription length, craft authenticity,a n dmin- imum price. In Figures 5–7, we focus on these three main outcome variables and compare treated and con- trol restaurants in three different ways. First, we visu- ally inspect the evolution of the differences between the subsample of treated and control restaurants. In Figure 5, we plot two periods before and two periods after the publication of the Guide, an event marked with a vertical line. In the case of this subsample of restaurants, the charts show general stability in differ- ences between periods 22a n d21, followed by a signiﬁcant increase in favor of treated restaurants in period 1. Two things are worth emphasizing here. First, the pre-Michelin observation we leverage in our main analyses is the one from period21, which corre- sponds to the weeks immediately after the Guide’s release was announced. The stability in differences be- tween periods22a n d21 should, hence, mitigate con- cerns about the presence of an announcement effect captured by our data. Second, the post-Michelin ob- servation we leverage in our main analyses is the one from period 2. We had made this choice to account for seasonality and compare menus from similar periods in the year (summer 2016 versus summer 2017). How- ever, it should be noted that period 2 falls immediate- ly before the publication of the following edition of the Guide, when the ranking was arguably the most unstable. This may explain why our effects seem to peak in period 1. In light of this descriptive evidence, the estimates from our main analyses seem somewhat conservative. One could indeed argue that they cap- ture the persistent, long-term effects of the status shock. Still, given the size of the subsample of restau- rants on which these analyses are based, we do not feel comfortable generalizing these conclusions to the full population of restaurants. Next, we look at from where the differences dis- played in the previous graphs come, by separating the trends for treated and control restaurants. Figure6 shows that, at least in this subsample, treated and con- trol restaurants were moving in the same direction be- fore the publication of the guide and then parted ways after the guide was released (vertical line). The patterns in the graphs are in line with what we ob- served when discussing variations in treated and con- trol groups. For minimum prices, we do see treated restaurants from this subsample increase prices for a narrower time span compared with what we observe for the full population of treated restaurants in the pa- per. Last, we perform a leads and lags analysis, in which we examine the effect of treatment on the main outcome variables during the four periods. We set the pre-treatment period21 as the reference value. Figure 7 shows the results of this analysis, which are consis- tent with what we observed in our graphical inspec- tion of the differences. The parallel trends assumption seems not to be violated in pre-treatment periods, at least for the subsample of restaurants from which we can inspect the data, as the treatment effect is not sig- niﬁcantly different in periods22 and 21 for any of the three outcome variables. Once again, we see some evidence of a treatment effect that peaks after the Guide came out and seems to fade off over time, in an- ticipation of the next release in October 2017. If con- ﬁrmed for the full population of restaurants, this evi- dence could suggest that the effects detected in the paper are smaller than those observed immediately fol- lowing the Guide’s publication. But, again, given the size of the subsample, we suggest caution when draw- ing conclusions. More generally, we recommend read- ing the evidence presented across the sets ofﬁgures as showing no suspicious violation of the parallel trends assumption, as opposed to showing support for it. Synthetic Control.One last concern could be related to our choice of control groups. The presence of two controls should partially mitigate this concern, partic- ularly in light of the trends we discussed above when commenting on the behavior of control restaurants. Figure 4.(Color online) Timeline of Observations for Robustness Test of Parallel Trends Assumption Note. The ﬁgure shows the timeline of observations for the subsample of treated (n 5 25) and control 2 (n 5 22) restaurants for which we can vi- sually inspect pre/post trends, as per Figures5–7. Favaron, Di Stefano, and Durand:Organizational Responses to Status Shocks Management Science, 2022, vol. 68, no. 9, pp. 6925–6949, © 2022 INFORMS 6941 We, nevertheless, decided to include an additional ro- bustness test using a synthetic control group. The method is based on the construction of a synthetic control unit that represents a weighted combination of many untreated cases (Abadie and Gardeazabal 2003, Abadie et al.2010), with weights calculated to maximize the similarity between the synthetic control and the treatment unit in terms of prespeciﬁed match- ing variables. Synthetic controls offer a formal and more objective approach compared with traditional, manual selection of control cases, and they maximize the observable similarity with the treatment unit (Pierce et al. 2020). In our case, we constructed a synthetic control group using restaurants from both control 1 and control 2 and matching on pre-treatment values for cuisine type, price level, rating, and self- presentation attributes (i.e.,description length, size de- scription, natural authenticity, craft authenticity, average price, andminimum price). The estimated models based on 100,000 permutations yielded the same results from a comparison with our original control groups, as reported in Table4. In particular, we observe a sig- niﬁcant increase in description length (18.6%, p 5 0.015), craft authenticity(124.4%, p 5 0.022), andmini- mum price(15.4%, p 5 0.015). We graph these results in Figure8, while Online Appendix 5 includes results Figure 5.(Color online) Differences Between Treated and Control 2 Before and After the Guide’sP u b l i c a t i o n Notes.

Discussion We are used to thinking of high-status actors as enjoy- ing the great beneﬁts that come from their position, without a worry in the world. High-status actors can command higher prices, face lower costs, have easier access to resources, and enjoy greater freedom to devi- ate from norms (Podolny1993, Benjamin and Podolny 1999, Phillips and Zuckerman 2001, Sauder et al. 2012). But previous work also tells us that there is a dark side to the attribution of status: Status comes, but status can also go. And so, high-status actors may ex- perience insecurity, feel the need to conform, and take actions to justify their position and show that they be- long (Jensen and Roy 2008, Sauder and Espeland 2009, Phillips et al.2013, Hahl and Zuckerman2014, Kov´acs and Sharkey2014, Hahl et al.2017, Jourdan et al. 2017, Prato et al. 2019). In this paper, we ex- ploited the exogenous shock produced by the Michel- in Guide’s entry to Washington, DC, in the fall of 2016. We illustrate how, following a status gain, or- ganizations enacted a series of changes to their self- presentation, an effort to conform to what they believe audiences expect from high-status players. Our results suggest that newly recognized high- status restaurants reacted to their new status position by acting on three sets of self-presentation attributes. They modiﬁed how their menus looked, by making their descriptive attributes consistent with the ethos of the elite. They emphasized their techniques and ingre- dients, to display the authenticity that characterizes elite players. And,ﬁnally, they adjusted pricing to sig- nal awareness of thevalue they created for their cus- tomers. Results from our analyses suggest that all status-shocked restaurants acted on all sets of attrib- utes, but that the tendency to act was stronger for organizations that did not occupy the top of the rank- ing— that is, restaurants that were not awarded Michelin stars. We also looked at how an organiza- tion’s standing prior to the status shock affected their need to modify self-presentation attributes. Contrary to our expectations, our results suggest that restau- rants with high prior standing, which should have been less concerned about showing their worth, em- phasized attributes that channeled authenticity and value— a tendency we explain in light of their being potentially subject to the denigrating tendencies de- scribed by Hahl and colleagues (Hahl and Zuckerman 2014, Hahl et al.2017). Actors with low prior standing, on the other hand, acted on descriptive attributes that Figure 6.(Color online) Variations in Treated and Control 2 Before and After the Guide’sP u b l i c a t i o n Notes. The ﬁgure shows the trends for the subsample of treated (n 5 25) and control 2 (n 5 22) restaurants. We plot two periods before and two periods after the publication of the Guide (vertical line). Favaron, Di Stefano, and Durand:Organizational Responses to Status Shocks Management Science, 2022, vol. 68, no. 9, pp. 6925–6949, © 2022 INFORMS 6943 signaled an ability to“ﬁt the mold” and their belong- ing among the elite (Askin and Bothner2016). Our theory is about modiﬁcations to self-presentation attributes and does not necessarily imply that status- shocked restaurants made operational changes. How- ever, we have reasons to believe that, at least in some cases, changes in self-presentation could reﬂect materi- al changes in operations. Intuitively, the extent to which a change in presentation can also reﬂect a change in operations varies depending on the type of menu attributes we examine. For instance, one could argue that while a change in the length of a description does not imply changes in operations, removing refer- ences to portion sizes could potentially reﬂect a choice to limit the amount of food served per dish. Similarly, a change in authenticity attributes could potentially re- ﬂect an actual operational change in the cooking tech- niques used and, hence, the tools needed in the kitchen or the ingredients sourced. Finally, our intuition with respect to value attributes is that while changes in min- imum prices mostly act as a signaling device, average prices may potentially capture operational changes. Results from the analyses above show signi ﬁcant changes indescription lengthand minimum price,w h i c h are the least likely to imply changes in operations. We also have no evidence of a signiﬁcant change inaverage price, which could have reﬂected the need to adapt pricing to cover for expensive operational changes. On the other hand, we do report signiﬁcant changes in craft authenticity, and in the case of non-starred restau- rants, size description and natural authenticity— all changes that could potentially reﬂect changes in a res- taurant’s operations. In light of this intuition, ourﬁnd- ings about the moderating role of prior standing could be suggestive of another fundamental difference in the behavior of status-shocked restaurants, depending on their prior standing. Theﬁnding that restaurants with high prior standing mostly emphasized authenticity Figure 7.(Color online) Treatment Effect Estimates Before and After the Guide’sP u b l i c a t i o n Notes. The ﬁgure reports the results of a leads and lags analysis, in which we examine the effect of treatment on the main outcome variables for the subsample of treated (n 5 25) and control 2 (n 5 22) restaurants. We plot two periods before and two periods after the publication of the Guide (vertical line) and set pre-treatment period21 as the reference value. Circles indicate treatment coefﬁcient estimates, with conﬁdence bands at 95%. Favaron, Di Stefano, and Durand:Organizational Responses to Status Shocks 6944 Management Science, 2022, vol. 68, no. 9, pp. 6925–6949, © 2022 INFORMS and value attributes could suggest that, in their case, the Michelin designation triggered operational changes. This seems not to be the case for restaurants with low prior standing, which mostly acted on descriptive at- tributes that did not necessarily imply operational changes and could be easily manipulated to signal be- longing among the elite. Unfortunately, our data do not allow us to further disentangle this interesting link between changes in self-presentation and changes in operations. Based on prior work (e.g., Rao et al.2003, 2005), our own exper- tise, and interviews conducted for this study, our intu- ition is that the mere inclusion in the Guide does not require restaurants to make costly investments to “raise their game.” However, for restaurants whose position in the ranking is more prominent, material changes may indeed be required for self-presentation changes to be credible. This may explain why restau- rants with high prior standing were more likely to change attributes that could imply a change in opera- tions. Similarly, chefs from Michelin-starred restau- rants explained to us how their customers expected “Easter eggs”(i.e., an amuse bouche before the starter or petit fours and chocolate pralines with coffee). An accomplished chef compared two colleagues who had been recently awarded their second star and ex- plained to us how one chef, located in a rural village, could have used the star as an opportunity to grow his business, while the other chef, located in the center of a major city, would have been“forced” to make costly investments that would have substantially shrunk his margins. One of the interviewees quoted in Sands (2020) similarly mentioned how the chefs of a newly starred restaurant sought better and better in- gredients, with a disastrous effect on proﬁtability, because of their focus on being“the Michelin star” restaurant. Consistent with this intuition, the very few starred restaurants in our sample raised minimum and average prices well above their non-starred coun- terparts (respectively, 136% and 119% versus 13% and 12%). Future work could further explore this conjecture. From a theoretical standpoint, ourﬁndings speak to two areas of broad interest. First, we contribute to a better understanding of how organizations react to status changes. We show that high-status actors do not simply exploit the opportunities that status pro- vides, but enact changes to align their operations and Figure 8.(Color online) Synthetic Control Estimates of Treatment Effects Notes. We construct a synthetic control group using restaurants from both control 1 and control 2 and matching on pre-treatment values for cui- sine type, price level, rating, and self-presentation attributes. The estimated models are based on 100,000 permutations. For each variable, the panels on the left compare treated and control groups, while panels on the right show changes from the pre-Michelin level for treated restaurants only. Values on the vertical axes should be divided by 100. Online Appendix 5 includes results for all six outcome variables, both in the case of all restaurants and in the case of non-starred restaurants only. Favaron, Di Stefano, and Durand:Organizational Responses to Status Shocks Management Science, 2022, vol. 68, no. 9, pp. 6925–6949, © 2022 INFORMS 6945 identity to the ethos of the elite— a representation that gets reinforced as actors with newly acquired status positions implement the corresponding changes (Goffman 1959, Jourdan et al.2017). By providing evi- dence of how producers’perception of status alters and directs their behavior, we offer a perspective that is complementary to the traditional emphasis on how audiences perceive high-status producers (and how the latter accrue rents from audiences’perceptions). In this respect, weﬁnd it telling that establishments with high prior standing also engaged in substantial modi- ﬁcations of their self-presentation attributes. Future research could further investigate how producers ’ perceptions of their own identity and group member- ship inﬂuence their behavior. Second, we contribute to research on status and conformity by disentangling the sources and types of conformity behaviors that newly awarded high-status actors deploy. By suggesting that status insecurity may drive high-status actors to conform to what they believe audiences expect from high-status players, we reﬁne the dominant idea that high-status actors are less likely to conform to what is normal or observable in the industry (Phillips and Zuckerman 2001). By showing that the high-status group conforms in order to be perceived as a worthy member of the elite, we go beyond the traditional view of conformity as pas- sive imitation (Philippe and Durand2011, Bromley and Powell 2012, Carlos and Lewis2018) and intro- duce a notion ofaspirational conformity. By emphasiz- ing the complex interplay between self-presentation and operational changes, we also contribute to recent work on the strategic use of conformity (Kim and Jen- sen 2011, Durand and Kremp2016). We believe future research could further unpack these dynamics and provide robust empirical evidence on the operational implications of aspirational conformity. From an empirical standpoint, the use of a DID ap- proach with multiple control groups enables us to more precisely link changes in restaurants’behavior to the status shock they experienced following the in- troduction of a new, inﬂuential status hierarchy. In doing so, we overcome the identiﬁcation issues that may be associated with examining changes within ex- isting status hierarchies without a clearly stipulated counterfactual and/or control population (Azoulay et al. 2013). By providing real-world evidence of ac- tors’behavior, we also complement recent empirical work conducted in the laboratory (Hahl and Zucker- man 2014,H a h le ta l .2017). Notwithstanding these advantages, the paper is not without limitations. Our analysis is restricted to a single city and based on two observations per restaurant (onepre- and onepost-treat- ment). This means that our sample size and the number of observations from which we draw inferences is rela- tively small. Although we adopted several measures to achieve a convincing identiﬁcation strategy, replicating these results in other geographical areas with larger samples would substantiate and add validity to our re- sults. Second, we examined the introduction of a status ranking produced by the most prominent evaluator in our industry of reference. Washington, DC, was indeed only the fourth city in the United States to be acknowl- edged by Michelin as worthy of their attention. Such exclusivity clearly exacerbated insecurity pressures as- sociated with the establishment of the new status hier- archy, as all restaurants included in the Guide were admitted for theﬁrst time to a ranking that allowed them to join the elite of the industry. Third, we focus on an industry characterized by uncertainty in the assess- m e n to fq u a l i t y( S h a r k e ya n dK o v´ acs 2018). The higher uncertainty that surrounds the assessment of quality in experience goods, like a restaurant meal, compared with physical goods may further exacerbate the insecurity ex- perienced by actors following a positive status shock. Future research could lead to a better understand- ing of how restaurants react to the rapidly evolving landscape of status evaluations. Nowadays, the evalu- ations provided by Michelin or prominent local critics coexist with customer evaluations from food bloggers, inﬂuencers, and ordinary customers contributing to Google, OpenTable, TripAdvisor, or Yelp. Another in- teresting extension of our work would involve its rep- lication in other settings. Although an obvious choice would be to replicate these results in industries that have been frequently investigated by status scholars in the past, we believe these results have a broader appeal and generalizability. Rankings and ratings generate status ladders that impact everyﬁrm in any industry, no matter whether based on performance excellence or normative criteria, such as environmen- tal protection or fair human treatment (Chatterji and Toffel 2010). When extending this research to other in- dustries, it may be worth considering how positive status shocks affect the audience of the awarded actor. In some cases, changes may be driven by the need to appeal to different audiences rather than please one single critical audience (Kov´acs and Sharkey2014). Fi- nally, a natural development of this study would ex- amine the performance implications of the changes we observe. Our data do now allow us to tackle this point, but we would expect to observe a positive effect on performance, driven by a reduction in the disso- nance between the market identity of the restaurant and the expectations of customers (Wang et al.2016). Future studies could test such an effect and identify the associated scope conditions, mechanisms, and moderators.

The authors’colleagues at Bocconi, HEC Paris, and SKEMA showed great stamina enduring way too many coffee breaks and lunches when this was all we could talk about. Last but not least, the paper tremen- dously beneﬁted from the insights of department editor Lamar Pierce, as well as the anonymous associate editor and three reviewers. Together, they guided the authors through an immensely rewarding process, for which they are very grateful. It does takes a village, and the authors are proud to have such a great one.

This was not feasible in our context, as we did not have information about subjects that nearly missed in- clusion in the guide. Out of curiosity, we tried to identify a set of con- trol restaurants that could have expected to be included in the guide based on their price level, cuisine type, Yelp rating, and local critical acclaim. This led us to single out 20 restaurants that were ultimately not included in the guide. Descriptively, we observed no difference in behavior between these 20 and other restaurants in the control group. 8 The 2017 edition of the Michelin Guide featured 106 restaurants, 12 of which were awarded stars. One restaurant was closed within one year from the publication of the guide. We were able to obtain accurate information for the years 2016 and 2017 for a total of 83 res- taurants (eight with stars and 75 without stars), which constituted our treated group. 9 See: https:/ /www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/food/what- Michelin-gets-wrong-about-dcs-dining-scene–starting-with-rasika/ 2016/10/13/3fb750de-90c0-11e6-9c52-0b10449e33c4_story.html?utm_ term=.edb9d879502e. 10 Washington and Boston, in 2016, had a comparable population (675,254 versus 678,430 (U.S. Census Bureau)) and a comparable number (1,312 versus 1,209 (Yelp)) of medium- and high-end res- taurants (average meal price above $10). 11 One anonymous reviewer correctly pointed out that our results could be driven by a decrease in the number of dishes, because our dependent variables are calculated“per dish.” To rule out this pos- sibility, we ran our model using number of dishes as a dependent variable and found no significant change from 2016 to 2017. We also replicated all analyses using the raw word count fordescription length, size description, craft authenticity, andnatural authenticity.R e - sults are in line with those presented in the paper. 12 In the classification of authenticity by Carroll and Wheaton (2009), natural authenticity could be interpreted as part of what they describe as craft authenticity or, alternatively, as moral authen- ticity, to the extent that restaurants want to signal ethical behavior. However, these classifications are not fixed or universally adopted. Dutton (2003), for instance, associates natural authenticity with nominal authenticity. We, hence, chose to adapt existing classifica- tions to our empirical context. Following Rao et al. (2005), we distin- guish between natural and craft authenticity to represent the dichot- omy between raw materials and cooking techniques. 13 We are thankful to the editorial team for inspiring us to include this additional dimension of analysis. 14 Given the size of our sample, and related concerns about power, we conducted ex post power computations, as per Online Appendix 2. Results suggest that our power is within reasonable ranges, but we do tend to be slightly underpowered (∼60%–70%) in the case of non-starred restaurants. The values are still above the averages re- ported by Cashen and Geiger (2004); we, nevertheless, suggest some caution in drawing inferences from our results for non-starred restaurants, given the higher risk of type II errors. 15 In their study on the effect of names of menu items on customers’ perceptions, Wansink et al. (2002) found that adding one or two evocative words to the names of two items in the menu of the facul- ty cafeteria at the University of Illinois generated a 27% increase in the sales of those items and benefited the overall attitude toward both the food and the restaurant. The experimenter manipulated a total of six menu items by adding the words in italics:Traditional Ca- jun Red Beans with Rice; Succulent Italian Seafood Filet; Tender Grilled Chicken; Home-style Chicken Parmesan; Satin Chocolate Pudding; andGrandma’s Zucchini Cookies. 16 We considered the alternative of adding prior standing as a mod- erator in our Equation (1) through a three-way interaction. We ulti- mately decided against this empirical strategy, however, for two reasons. First, in the case of Washington, DC, there is high overlap between treated and prior standing, whereas only 11 out of the 143 control restaurants had high prior standing. Such an unbalanced distribution would have made the three-way interaction uninforma- tive. Second, we attempted to collect a measure of prior standing for the matched restaurants in control 2, but soon realized that the evaluations available for Boston were not directly comparable with those available for Washington, DC. The rankings published byThe Washington Postand theWashingtonian are very consistent with our notion of prior standing. The former identifies the top 10 and top 50 restaurants in DC; the latter ranks the top 100. The evaluations pro- vided byThe Boston Globeand Boston Magazine, on the other hand, reward restaurants that are trending for specific features (such as healthy lunch, new arrival, etc.), thus failing to provide an overall evaluation that ranks top restaurants and sets them apart. 17 Results from ex post power computations, reported in Online Appendix 2, suggest that our power is within reasonable ranges, Favaron, Di Stefano, and Durand:Organizational Responses to Status Shocks Management Science, 2022, vol. 68, no. 9, pp. 6925–6949, © 2022 INFORMS 6947 but relatively lower (∼60–70%) only forcraft authenticityand mini- mum price(control 2 only) in the case of restaurants with low prior standing. The values are above the averages reported by Cashen and Geiger (2004), but still suggest caution in drawing inferences. 18 See https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/food-dining/2016/10/ 10/getting-its-first-michelin-restaurant-guide-why-not-boston/ NT1eXE8L30OKlaM8BldpCI/story.html .

### Controlled Vocabulary and Alias Mapping (Canonicalization)

- Use canonical labels for recurring constructs/measurements; map near-synonyms to the canonical `term` and record alternatives in `aliases`.
- Examples (non-exhaustive; prefer these canonical labels):
  - presence_of_a_star (aliases: ["star_presence", "star firm"])
  - innovative_productivity (aliases: ["patent-weighted productivity"])
  - innovative_leadership_among_non_star_scientists (aliases: ["innovative leadership"])
  - breadth_of_star_expertise (aliases: ["technological breadth of star"])
  - star_collaborative_strength (aliases: ["star’s collaborative strength"])
  - product_market_entry_rate (aliases: ["rate of product market entry", "product/future product market entry"])
  - competitor_diversity (aliases: ["diversity_of_multimarket_contact"])
  - guanxi_with_business_community (dimension)
  - guanxi_with_government_authorities (dimension)
- When the paper distinguishes guanxi dimensions, extract them as separate constructs and reflect hierarchy via `construct_dimensions`.

### Minimal Coverage and Coverage Report

- Aim for minimal coverage where applicable (justify exceptions in `coverage_report.reason`):
  - Quantitative: ≥ 10 constructs; ≥ 12 relationships; ≥ 6 measurements
  - Qualitative/Conceptual: ≥ 8 constructs; ≥ 2 relationships; measurements optional
  - Simulation/ABM/Modeling: include `Model_Result`-anchored relationships and key parameters; measurements optional
- If unmet, include a root-level `coverage_report` with counts (or "none_found") and a brief `reason`. Add `errors` such as "no_anchor_found", "insufficient_evidence" when applicable.

### Anchor Priority and Normalization

- Prioritize anchoring to: Hypothesis/Proposition IDs > Theorem/Proposition_Label > Model_Result > Core_Claim.
- Titles: extract verbatim paper title; exclude series labels (e.g., "Research Notes and Commentaries").
- Journal: output full official name as shown in the paper.
- DOI: remove the URL scheme; return `doi.org/...` or bare DOI string.
