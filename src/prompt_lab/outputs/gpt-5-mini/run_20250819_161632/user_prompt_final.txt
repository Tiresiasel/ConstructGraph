# ROLE AND GOAL
You are an extremely meticulous, detail-oriented research analyst and knowledge engineer. Your sole task is to act as an information extraction engine, strictly following the provided JSON Schema to convert unstructured text from the provided academic paper into structured knowledge.

## CORE DIRECTIVES

1. **Fidelity to Source** - All information you extract must originate directly from the provided paper text. You are strictly forbidden from making inferences, guessing, or adding external knowledge. If information is not present, use `null` or an empty array `[]`
2. **Schema is Supreme** - Your output must be, and can only be, a single, valid JSON object that strictly conforms to the provided JSON Schema. Do not add any explanations, comments, or Markdown formatting outside the JSON object
3. **Comprehensive Coverage** - You must make your best effort to comprehensively scan the entire paper (from abstract to references) to ensure all required information is extracted without omission
4. **Titles and Journal Names** - For `paper_metadata.title`, extract the title verbatim exactly as it appears in the paper (preserve any prefixes/suffixes, punctuation, diacritics, and casing; do not drop or normalize anything). For `paper_metadata.journal`, extract the full official journal name exactly as shown in the paper (no abbreviations or variants; preserve punctuation and casing).
5. **DOI Formatting** - For `paper_metadata.doi`, if the DOI appears as a URL (e.g., `https://doi.org/10.1000/xyz123`), return everything after the URL scheme (remove `http://` or `https://`), e.g., `doi.org/10.1000/xyz123`. If a bare DOI string is present (e.g., `10.1000/xyz123`), return it as-is.

## MULTI-STEP CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT PROCESS

Execute the following tasks in strict sequence to ensure the completeness and accuracy of the extraction:

## SCOPE POLICY (Layered: Core + Secondary)

- Core scope (mandatory): ONLY extract constructs, relationships, and measurements that are explicitly tied to Hypotheses/Propositions or appear in clearly labeled "Hypothesis Development"/"Proposition" sections. Each extracted item MUST include an anchoring field to identify the hypothesis/proposition (see schema additions below).
- Secondary scope (allowed, minimal):
  - Measurements for the core constructs, even if described in Methods/Measures section, as long as they can be explicitly mapped back to a core construct.
  - Results that explicitly confirm or refute a specific hypothesis/proposition (Empirical_Result) and can be linked to its identifier.
- Out of scope: Exploratory/ancillary relationships, general literature review claims, or findings that are not clearly tied to a numbered/named hypothesis/proposition or its direct development.

### Phase 1: Initial Scan & Global Classification

1. Read the entire paper to understand its overall structure and purpose.
2. Extract the top-level metadata to populate the `paper_metadata` section.
3. **Crucially, classify the `research_type`** based on its methodology. Is it `Quantitative`, `Qualitative`, `Conceptual`, `Review`, `Meta-Analysis`, or `Mixed-Methods`?
4. **Identify Replication Study**: Determine if the paper is explicitly a `Replication Study` and set the `is_replication_study` boolean accordingly.

### Phase 2: Relationship-First Identification and Construct Harvesting (Core-only)

This is the most critical phase. Your primary goal is to find all relationship claims first, as this guarantees the capture of all relevant constructs.

1. **Systematic Search for Claims**: Meticulously scan the paper, focusing on the **Hypotheses, Hypothesis Development, Propositions, and Results sections**. Identify ONLY claims that belong to a Hypothesis or Proposition (including their development) or that explicitly confirm/refute them in Results.
2. **Harvest Constructs from Claims**: For **every single relationship claim** you identify, immediately extract all the construct `term`s mentioned within that claim (e.g., the subject, object, moderators, mediators).

   **CRITICAL RULE FOR CONSTRUCT NAMES:**
   - Extract ONLY the FULL construct name, NOT abbreviations in parentheses
   - **Examples of CORRECT extraction:**
     - ✅ "organizational commitment" (NOT "organizational commitment (OC)")
     - ✅ "network constraint" (NOT "network constraint (NC)")
     - ✅ "structural holes" (NOT "structural holes (SH)")
   - **Examples of INCORRECT extraction:**
     - ❌ "organizational commitment (OC)"
     - ❌ "network constraint (NC)"
     - ❌ "structural holes (SH)"
   - **Rule**: Remove ALL parenthetical abbreviations and keep only the complete construct name
   - **Global Application**: Apply the same rule to ALL terms (constructs, moderators, mediators, controls) AND to measurement names. Examples:
     - ✅ "distance" (NOT "distance (d)")
     - ✅ "return on assets" (NOT "return on assets (ROA)")
     - ✅ "research and development intensity" (NOT "R&D intensity")

   **CRITICAL RULE FOR DETAILED EXTRACTION:**
   - **Definitions must be comprehensive**: Extract the FULL definition, not just a brief mention
   - **Context must be rich**: Include enough context so someone unfamiliar with the paper can understand the concept
   - **Examples**: If the paper provides examples, include them in the definition
   - **Operational details**: Include how the construct is operationalized or measured
   - **Boundary conditions**: Extract any limitations or conditions mentioned for the construct
   - **Measurements must be detailed**: Include complete measurement procedures, scales, formulas, and validation details

   **CRITICAL RULE FOR CONSTRUCT SELECTION:**
   - **ONLY extract theoretical constructs** that appear in propositions, hypotheses, or theoretical frameworks
   - **Include related measurements** ONLY for those constructs mentioned in hypotheses/propositions
   - **Include control variables** ONLY when they have clear theoretical justification and are explicitly tied to the hypotheses/propositions
   - **Examples of what NOT to extract**: "p-value", "sample size", standalone mathematical parameters not framed as constructs
   - **Examples of what TO extract**: "modularity", "network constraint", "structural holes", "organizational commitment"
3. **Compile a Master List (Core Anchored)**: Create a master list of all construct `term`s harvested from the core claims only. For each item, capture the hypothesis/proposition identifier when available (e.g., `H1`, `H1a`, `P2`).

### Phase 3: Construct De-duplication, Dimension Identification & Definition Search

1. **De-duplicate**: Create a unique set of construct `term`s from the master list compiled in Phase 2.
2. **Identify Dimensions**: Re-examine the paper, especially the literature review and theory sections. If the paper describes a construct (e.g., "Organizational Justice") as being composed of multiple dimensions (e.g., "Distributive Justice," "Procedural Justice"), you must capture these hierarchical links and populate the `construct_dimensions` array.
3. **Targeted Definition Search**: For **each unique term**, now go back through the paper and search for its most explicit, verbatim `definition` and `context_snippet`.

   **CRITICAL - Detailed Definition Extraction:**
   - **Definitions must be comprehensive**: Extract the FULL definition, not just a brief mention
   - **Context must be rich**: Include enough context so someone unfamiliar with the paper can understand the concept
   - **Examples**: If the paper provides examples, include them in the definition
   - **Mathematical notation**: If the construct involves mathematical formulas or parameters, extract them completely
   - **Operational details**: Include how the construct is operationalized or measured
   - **Boundary conditions**: Extract any limitations or conditions mentioned for the construct
4. **Populate Constructs Array**: Populate the `constructs` array in the final JSON with every unique term and its found definition. If a term involved in a relationship has no explicit definition, it **must** still be included in this array (its `definition` field can be `null`).

### Phase 4: In-depth, Methodology-Aware Relationship Characterization

Now, return to the relationship claims identified in Phase 2 and characterize them in detail.

1. **Identify General Properties**:
   - Clearly identify the `subject_term` and `object_term`.
   - Determine the `status`: is it a `Hypothesized` claim or an `Empirical_Result`?
   - Find any `supporting_theories`, `moderators`, and `mediators`.
   - **Extract Boundary Conditions**: Extract any `boundary_conditions` the authors set for the hypothesis or finding (e.g., "only in high-tech industries").
   - **Extract Replication Outcome**: If the paper is a replication study, determine and extract the `replication_outcome` for key relationships (`Successful`, `Failed`, or `Mixed`).

2. **Branch Extraction by Evidence Type**:
   - **If the evidence is Quantitative**:
     - Set `evidence_type` to `Quantitative`.
     - Extract `effect_direction`, `non_linear_type`, `is_meta_analysis`, `is_validated_causality`.
     - Additionally, populate `causal_support_level`, `design_type`, `manipulated_variable`, and optional `causal_notes` for each specific subject→object relationship.
     - Leave qualitative fields as `null`.
   - **If the evidence is Qualitative**:
     - Set `evidence_type` to `Qualitative`.
     - Extract the `qualitative_finding` and `supporting_quote`.
     - Leave all quantitative fields as `null`.

   **STRICT RULES for Moderators and Non-linear Effects**:
   - Moderators: Only extract a variable as a moderator when the paper explicitly labels it as a moderator or clearly claims a moderating effect (e.g., "X moderates the relationship between A and B", "we test moderation by X"). Do not infer moderators from generic interaction terms unless explicitly described as moderation by the authors.
   - Non-linear Effects: Only set `effect_direction` to a non-linear category or `non_linear_type` when the paper explicitly states a form (e.g., "U-shaped", "inverted U-shaped", "S-shaped", "curvilinear with U-shape"). The mere presence of polynomial terms or curvature tests without explicit labeling must NOT be treated as non-linear.

### Phase 5: Measurement Extraction (Secondary allowed to support Core)

For constructs that are operationalized in the methodology section, extract their specific `measurement` methods ONLY if they map directly to a core-scoped construct (from Phases 2–4). Ensure explicit mapping from measurement to the construct and, when applicable, to the linked hypothesis/proposition identifier.

**CRITICAL - Comprehensive Measurement Extraction:**
- **Extract complete measurement procedures**: Include step-by-step operationalization details
- **Include measurement scales**: Extract the specific scales, questionnaires, or instruments used
- **Mathematical formulas**: If measurements involve formulas or calculations, extract them completely
- **Validation details**: Include reliability, validity, and other psychometric properties mentioned
- **Examples of items**: If the paper provides sample questionnaire items, include them
- **Scoring procedures**: Explain how responses are converted to construct scores
- **Context-specific details**: Include any industry-specific or context-specific measurement adaptations

## Theory Extraction (Core-only)

Goal:
Extract only the theories that explicitly ground the paper’s core claims. Exclude background/literature-survey theories that are not used to justify the core arguments.

Inclusion (must satisfy ALL):
- The theory is explicitly used to justify a core claim.
- The claim is anchored to one of the following (ordered by strength):
  1) Hypothesis / Proposition with identifier (e.g., H1, H1a, P2)
  2) Formal label: Theorem / Proposition / Lemma / Corollary (e.g., T1, P1, L1, C1)
  3) Model Result (e.g., “Result 1”, “We show that…”, “The model predicts that…”)
  4) Core Claim sentence (e.g., “we propose/argue/show/predict that…”, “it follows that…”, “implies that…”)
- Provide at least one textual anchor: section_header and/or a short context_snippet containing the grounding phrase (e.g., “drawing on”, “based on”, “grounded in”).
- Do NOT include theories mentioned only as prior work without being used to justify a core claim.

Strict rules:
- Name hygiene: output the full theory name only; drop parenthetical abbreviations (e.g., use “resource-based view”, not “RBV (resource-based view)”).
- Origin source: set origin_source to one of Hypothesis | Proposition | Hypothesis_Development | Results-Confirming | Theorem | Proposition_Label | Model_Result | Core_Claim
- Claims linkage: 
  - If H/P is available, set hypothesis_id (e.g., H1, H1a, P2).
  - Always set claim_id (stable id) for the core claim (e.g., H1/H1a/P2/T1/Result1/CC1). If no author label exists, generate CC1/CC2… in reading order.

Dichotomies abound: East and West global and local, research and teaching, schol- arship and practice, among many others. But are they truly oppositional? Taking a broad view oí "culture" as a concept that encapsulates all human affairs, I propose that an "ambicultural" perspective and approach offer a way to integrate the best qualities of what may appear to be irreconcilable opposites. Expanding on my August 2013 Academy of Management presidential address, I suggest that guideposts to gaining this perspective can be found in both my personal journey and my experi- ences in research, teaching, and professional service and that "becoming ambicul- tural" is a process that individuals and organizations alike can undergo to bridge divides and unite "opposites." In this article I connect the ambicultural view to implications for management and organization research, for professional and per- sonal growth, for the future of the Academy, and for attainment of a balance and enlightenment transcending differences. My research in competitive dynamics offers an example of ambicultural integration of Chinese philosophy and Western social sciences. If the business world isf in fact, "growing smaller" - a phenomenon evidenced by the glo- balization of commerce and accelerated by dig- ital interconnectivity - it is a new world still marked by old divides.

The idea of "ambiculturalism" advances the per- spective that dichotomies can be integrated by separating the wheat from the chaff - extracting the best and culling the worst to produce a bet- ter, optimized, even enlightened result, be it product, service, management practice, or hu- man behavior. The effect of an ambicultural ap- proach to business, education, and life is a bal- ance that can close the chasms separating former "opposites." The construct of culture has been studied ex- tensively in the management literature. In the spirit of Confucian tradition (Ku, 1920), I take a capacious view of culture, Or "wen" (it), a broad notion that encompasses all human affairs.1 In 1 According to Ku, who offered one of the most authorita- tive English translations and interpretations of Confucius' thoughts, "When true moral being and moral order are real- ized (SWífl), the universe then becomes a cosmos and all things attain their full growth and development Ā4Ž&1IM) shall become a cosmos is called wen (fulfillment)" (1920: 15).

Considered as a social construct, cultures may be demarcated by geography (e.g., East and West), industry (business and nongovernmental organizations), professional groups (academics and practitioners), or disciplinary groups (econ- omists and sociologists) or by management practice and strategy (competitive and coopera- tive), to name a few (Liu, Friedman, Barry, Gelf- and, & Zhang, 2012). Ambiculturalism is in- formed by these various conceptions of culture at multiple levels of analysis in different contexts. Delineating the defining features of ambicul- turalism helps distinguish the concept from re- lated ideas, such as biculturalism (Benet- Martinez, Leu, Lee, & Morris, 2002; Mok & Morris, 2012) or multiculturalism (Fitzsimmons, 2013; Parekh, 2000; Taylor, 1991), yin-yang (Fang, 2011; Li, 2012), dialectic thinking (Lewis, 2000), and ambidexterity (Smith & Tushman, 2005). We might consider the distinctions in two ways. Firste in terms of context and level of analysis, ambicultural is multilevel and varied in na- ture - it can be applied to the individual, group, firm, and society - whereas the context for bicul- tural or multicultural, for instance, is typically national or ethnic and ambidexterity applies mainly to individual and organizational levels (O'Reilly & Tushman, in press). Second, ambicul- turalism has both strong behavioral tendencies (Swidler, 1986) and cognitive roots, whereas multiculturalism and bicultural identity are more cognitively rooted. Given its action orien- tation, ambiculturalism, as implied in the title of this article, is a continuous act of becoming, with emphasis on the process of learning and growing, rather than an arrived at or ideal state of being. The root of the prefix "ambi," meaning "around" and "both," conveys an active and on- going striving for expansiveness and inclusiveness. Ambiculturalism aims to integrate and opti- mize the best of two (or more) "cultures" while Similarly, from I Ching (the Book of Change): "Observe the human world to enculturate people eliminating the worst; thus, the ambicultural perspective recognizes not only the strengths but the pitfalls of Western and Eastern (repre- sented here by Chinese) business models (Chen & Miller, 2010). Further, ambiculturalism empha- sizes the merits of both/and integration as op- posed to either/or division; thus, the notion of paradoxical synthesis (and/or interdependence) of opposites (Chen, 2008; Jay, 2013; Poole & Van de Ven, 1989; Smith & Lewis, 2011), with philo- sophical roots in Eastern, yin-yang, and holistic thinking, is essential to the ambicultural con- cept.2 In this vein, ambiculturalism implies bal- ance and integration not only of geoeconomic cultures, such as East and West or global and local, but across a wide range of "opposites," such as teaching and practice or profit and non- profit organizations. Finally, boundary condi- tions exist for this concept such that the focal entities should have the necessary knowledge and appreciation of each culture and recognize the potential merit of blending the two, be mo- tivated to integrate cultures, and possess a com- petence to do so. In this article I take the position that the world is rife with divisions; that these divides can be addressed, bridged, and reconciled through an ambicultural approach akin to the one I have sought to follow in my life; and that embracing the idea of ambiculturalism promises profound implications - both immediate and long term - for organizations, business managers, and scholars. The example of my personal and pro- fessional journey should not be interpreted as a biographical review; rather, it provides a case study to put forward the promising idea of am- biculturalism, especially from a process viewpoint. The article begins with my ambicultural jour- ney as an individual learner and a scholar in competitive dynamics (a field that exemplifies ambicultural application in the academic arena). I then discuss my organization-building effort within the broad context of the Academy of 2 Chen and Miller identify qualities of ambiculturalism as, among others, "an ability to see the wisdom and strength in other cultural and business paradigms; . . . dedication to integrating global awareness into everyday ac- tions; . . . ability to balance social good and self- interest; . . . commitment to continued learning . . . and, ul- timately, to reaching the pinnacles of professional achievement and humanity" (2010: 22).

I conclude with re- search and managerial implications of the idea of ambiculturalism. AMBICULTURAL LEARNING ON THE EAST- WEST DIVIDE- AND BEYOND Two cultures and continents - Eastern and Western, Asia and North America - define the context for my life. In my career I have sought to bridge research and teaching, pursuing, usually simultaneously, diverse and sometimes conflict- ing activities alongside my academic research: teaching of all kinds, professional and commu- nity service, and managerial practice. Through- out my life and career, I have strived to be an ambicultural learner, an aspiration formed through my early life experience. A Personal Journey and Aspiration A modest beginning gave me a view of the world from the fringes. I was born and raised in one of the most undeveloped towns in Taiwan, where I lived with my family until the age of seventeen. Today, although my thoughts and actions continue to be informed by the marginal perspective of my youth, I see through an expan- sive prism. For this I have the mentoring of two inspiring role models to thank, one in the East in my early life, the other in the West as I made my way through an academic and professional maze that was as new and incredible to me as New York City compared with my hometown. Before I left Taiwan, it was my good fortune to study the Chinese classics with a master teacher, Aixinjueluo Yu-Yun (ItSifÄS-t/iiSl), a nephew of the "Last Emperor" of China (Chen, 2002). Master Yu himself was a "student" for a century, and he taught for more than sixty years until his death, in 2011, at the age of 106.3 Under his tutelage I had the opportunity to read the original work of sixteen of the most famous phi- losophers from the era considered the peak of 3 In addition to teaching hundreds of now well-accom- plished students in Taiwan over six decades, including the current prime minister of Taiwan, Master Yu also taught and mentored many renowned sinologists in the United States, among them Peter K. Bol, of Harvard University; Donald Munro, of the University of Chicago; Nathan Sivin, of the University of Pennsylvania; and Frederic Wakeman, Jr., of the University of California, Berkeley. ancient Chinese civilization (772-222 bc). This included intensive immersion in Sun Tzu and myriad interpretations of his work, which later would profoundly influence my research in com- petitive dynamics. Although the term manage- ment was foreign to Master Yu (this was not a concept he ever articulated), what he taught me was management of humanity. In the West I was fortunate and honored to be mentored by William H. Newman during the last twelve years of his life. The sixth president of the Academy of Management, Bill was a giant in the management field, both as an academic and a practitioner (the Academy's prestigious award for "best paper based on a dissertation" is named in his honor). Before going on to distin- guished tenures at the Wharton School and Co- lumbia Business School, Bill started his career in the business world as a protege of James McKinsey.4 Among the many words of wisdom and values Bill passed on to me, I took to heart two pieces of advice in particular. The first was "Be yourself, and aspire steadfastly to the high- est levels of integrity and dignity." This princi- ple helped me to think clearly when I found myself in situations of confusion or when I faced tough professional challenges. Bill showed me how to keep my standards up, and not at the expense of others. The second indelible lesson he imparted was the ability to see beyond cur- rent horizons and past the unseen. In a practical sense, this translates into a capacity for seeing the opposite in adverse situations.5 Through these life lessons Bill reminded me of my own cultural heritage, and I often perceived him as more "Chinese" than many of my Chinese friends.6 The juxtaposition of images of my East-West mentors, Master Yun-Yu and Bill Newman (Fig- ure 1), symbolizes the genesis of my ambicul- tural makeup. 4 James McKinsey was founder of the management con- sulting firm McKinsey & Company. 5 Bill's pragmatic wisdom captured an idea, now familiar in the West, expressed etymologically in the Chinese word for "crisis," which in one translation combines the two "op- posite" characters for danger and opportunity. In this con- notation every adversity holds the seed of opportunity. 6 Within the authentic Confucius tradition, "Chinese" is considered a way of thinking rather than a term defined by ethnicity.

Newman (1909-2002) Between these periods of profound mentor- ship, I was shaped by a formational experience that was essential to my scholarly progression and enabled me to begin to bridge my East-West gap. As a newly arrived foreign student in the 1980s at the University of Maryland, the only doctoral program that admitted me, I was aided immeasurably by faculty members who took me under their wing and taught me both the profes- sional skills and humanity concerns that have served me in the years since.7 These scholars also helped me adjust to my new home as I learned the nuances of Western culture and so- cial customs. With their assistance and through observation and disciplined practice, I made my first big strides toward ambiculturalism. The fusion of East and West would come to characterize my academic and professional tra- jectories. Since graduating from the University of Maryland, I have taught at schools whose histories are intertwined with those of American founding fathers and presidents: Columbia Uni- versity, the University of Pennsylvania, and the University of Virginia. I was placed at the heart of American tradition - it is impossible to live and work in New York, Philadelphia, and Char- lottesville without being acutely aware of the legacies of Hamilton, Franklin, and Jefferson, leaders both of their times and ahead of their times (with aspirations that appear, through the lens of history, as quite ambicultural). My growth as a balanced business academic is due in large measure to my life in these academic communities. The contrasting and sometimes opposing experiences I had at these institu- tions8 caused me to be deeply concerned about the divides in academia, in business, and in human lives. At the same time these experi- ences also prepared me for undertaking ambi- cultural drives on multiple fronts. By way of illustration, a few years ago I spoke at several large global forums. In Buenos Aires, São Paulo, and Milan, the biggest concern ex- pressed by Western business leaders was the "China threat." I ended the trip on the other side of the globe at a meeting in Beijing, where Larry Lang (the provocative finance expert/business 7 These scholars include Samuel Kotz, Alan N. Nash, the late Frank T. Paine, and Lee E. Preston, as well as Stephen Carroll, Jr., Martin J. Gannon, Kenneth G. Smith, Curtis Grimm, Edwin Locke, and Katherine Bartol. The list of men- tors should also include Mary Waldron, assistant director oí the Maryland doctoral program, and her family. 8 There are interesting contrasts among these schools. Columbia University and University oí Pennsylvania/ Wharton, ior instance, are research institutions, while teach- ing is paramount at University oí Virginia/Darden. At Darden, case and book writing are recognized as research; at Columbia and Wharton, to a great extent only publica- tions in iour leading journals are considered research. Darden maintains an open-door policy; posting oííice hours is taboo, since faculty members are expected to meet with students at any time, unlike a more conventional policy, where office hours are seen as a sign of responsibility.

Thus, in both hemi- spheres I found myself in an unanticipated am- bicultural role. To Western audiences I was compelled to explain that in adopting such col- orful expressions as "China threat/' they should consider factors A, B, and C; to Chinese audi- ences I suggested that they take into account X, Y, and Z before accepting "loaded" generaliza- tions about either China or the West. Consider- ing if not necessarily incorporating the other's view is the first and perhaps most essential step toward becoming ambicultural. In aspiring to "make the world smaller," I have tried steadfastly to follow a tenet of Con- fucian tradition: learning equates to practice (¥ÍŤ£-) and thinking equates to action (íDÍj'a - ). Applying this principle requires one to bridge pedagogy and practice. Thus, my life's aim has been to answer one big question: How can we transcend from "either/or" to "both/ and" - and ultimately become ambicultural? My work in competitive dynamics, the focus of my research over the past three decades, offers an example of ambicultural application in the scholarly arena. Professional Path: Competitive Dynamics As an Ambicultural Drive Competitive dynamics is one of the major lines of research that has emerged in the stra- tegic management field (Hambrick & Chen, 2008). Interest in competitive dynamics contin- ues to rise because of recent theoretical and empirical advancements, such as Lamberg, Tik- kanen, Nokelainen, and Suur-Inkeroinen (2009), Markman, Gianiodis, and Buchholtz (2009), Kilduff, Elfenbein, and Staw (2010), Livengood and Reger (2010), Zhang and Gimeno (2010), and Tsai, Su, and Chen (2011), to name a few. For instance, Chen and Miller (2013) reconceptual- ized competitive dynamics using a multidimen- sional framework and expanded the research domain into cooperative and relational modes of interfirm competition, taking into account a wide range of stakeholders with the aim of "raising all boats." Witnessing and contributing to the emergence of this topic from a phenome- non (MacMillan, McCaffery, & Van Wijk, 1985) to a theoretical perspective (Chen, 1996; Chen & Miller, 2012) have been infinitely rewarding. Although the intellectual development of com- petitive dynamics has been in the West, many of its ideas can be traced to Chinese philosophy or traditional systems of thought. The notion of "ir- reversibility" (Chen & MacMillan, 1992) can be found in a proverb about "sinking your boat before attacking your enemy" (ÎÈH/ZlÂ), and re- source-diversion strategies (McGrath, Chen, & MacMillan, 1998) correspond to the indirect com- petitive wisdom of "making noise in the East when attacking in the West" (SKSffi). Stealth and selective attack (Chen & Hambrick, 1995) relate to "a small, nimble fighter who chal- lenges its giant opponent" (tt<MllÀ), and the rival-centric perspective in competitor analysis (Tsai et al., 2011) puts to the test a well-known doctrine of Chinese military strategist and phi- losopher Sun Tzu: "If you know yourself and know your opponent, you can win 100 wars" (íQEl^QíjÍu WISW0). The list could go on. Thus, competitive dynamics - bridging Chinese tradi- tional thought and Western social science re- search - is a research topic that embraces and integrates, equally, Eastern and Western ideas and practices. More fundamentally, the ideas of duality and relativity form the basis of Chinese philosophy. In Chinese ren (fc) means humanity, as well as core, or the seed of a fruit. The character ren is composed of "two" (- ) + "person" (À): no person exists except in relationship to another. The idea of "self-other integration" (À-í£- 'n ) - which regards two opposites (such as "self" and "other") as interdependent, together forming a totality ("integration")9 - is a cornerstone of Chi- nese thinking (Chen, 2002). Making the intellec- tual connection to competitive dynamics, "self" can be equated to a focal firm or an action the firm initiates, while "other" is analogous to a competitor under consideration or a response it undertakes. Going a step further, competition and cooperation may be seen as two sides of the same coin, and their relationship of interdepen- dence is ambicultural in nature, as reflected in the notion of competition-cooperation (Chen, 9 The idea of complementary or interdependent oppo- sites - expressed as "both/and" - is rooted in the ancient Chinese concept of yin and yang. The origin of the Western notion of dichotomies - "either/or" - is found in the Aristote- lian logic of mutually exclusive categories, propounded more recently in the Hegelian/Marxian dialectics (Chen, 2008; Lewis, 2000; Poole & Van de Ven, 1989).

In competitive dynamics duality provides the philosophical foundation for the action- response dyad, while relativity forms the basis for the pairwise comparison between firms (Chen# 1996)# the two central premises of this line of work. Because of the "relational" philosophi- cal foundation, the awareness-motivation- capability (AMC) and market commonality- resource similarity (MC-RS) perspectives can be used for both competitive and cooperative anal- yses and applications (Chen & Miller, 2013). Methodologies and frameworks are integral to Western social sciences, and Western business practices are standardized and quantifiable; as a result, many tools have been developed to resolve practical problems. In contrast, the Chi- nese (as broadly representative of Eastern cul- ture and philosophy), with a longer cultural leg- acy, tend to be more experience or action driven. Differences notwithstanding, advantages can be found in each. With its emphasis on duality and relativity, competitive dynamics is an am- bicultural integration between Chinese philos- ophy and Western social sciences. To show how competitive dynamics optimally bridges East and West, philosophy and science, and scholar- ship and practice, Exhibit 1 organizes this line of research along four domains (philosophy, sys- tematic knowledge, case studies, and tools). Equally important, competitive dynamics pro- vides a promising platform for micro-macro in- tegration in management research (Chen & Miller, 2012). This is significant because micro and macro divides have long presented a net- tlesome challenge for the management field. In retrospect, for more than twenty years I was focused on adhering to the Western social sciences paradigm in my work on competitive EXHIBIT 1 Competitive Dynamics: An Ambicultural View Duality and relativity: Philosophy _ (ren or "core") = H (two) + A(individuals) - Self-other "integration" (He): rÀ-S-p j [~I I 1 !

Looking back one day, I was sur- prised - even shocked - to discover the rele- vance of Chinese philosophy to my Western social science research (Chen, 2002). Only then did I realize the impact that ancient Chinese thoughts, particularly duality and relativity, had on my research. (In an unrelated experience, I came to realize how I had benefited from the work of the journalist Ted Koppel, the master of incisive questioning whose groundbreaking television news magazine, Nightline, I watched devotedly when I arrived in the United States [Chen, 2010]. His professionalism and interroga- tive approach influenced my research, teaching, and practical work.) Pulling from unconnected pieces or even opposites thus has profoundly enriched my intellectual and professional growth. Likewise, to me, teaching in a classroom is no different from writing a paper or delivering a business address - they are "one" and the same thing (Chen, 2012); only the audience and format are different. In sum, divisions such as those separating East and West, micro and macro, scholarship and practice, and philosophy and science are omnipresent. So then are opportunities for am- bicultural integration (see Exhibit 2), as I have experienced in my personal and professional journey. DEVELOPING AMBICULTURAL ORGANIZATIONS A few years ago I mentioned to Andy Van de Ven, of the University of Minnesota, that the title of his book Engaged Scholarship (2007) was re- dundant in the Chinese context, to the extent that it relates to scholarly interaction beyond EXHIBIT 2 Ambicultural in Action Opposites Ambicultural integration East vs. West East-West Global vs. Local Global-Local Research vs. Teaching Research-Teaching Rigor vs. Relevance Rigor-Relevance Scholarship vs. Practice Scholarship-Practice Micro vs. Macro Micro-Macro Competition vs. Cooperation Competition-Cooperation Mainstream vs. Minority Mainstream-Minority Profit vs. Nonprofit Profit-Nonprofit Professionalism vs. Humanity Professionalism-Humanity the borders of academia. In contrast to the "ivory tower" notion of academia, in the Chinese con- text a scholar must always be engaged, caring for others and the community at large; in this way theory is translated into practice. Some Western scholars have embraced a "broader and more capacious" conception of scholarship, as Andy puts it, and he cites Boyer: "The work of the scholar also means stepping back from one's investigation, looking for connections, building bridges between theory and practice" (1990: 16). In the East the scholar's social role and mission have been regarded as virtually sacrosanct for almost 5,000 years. In accord with this ancient tradition, Chinese intellectuals, in fact, are not considered scholars until they "practice what they preach." It is this ideal of "passion and compassion" at the personal level (Tsui, 2013) that has so profoundly influenced academia throughout Chinese history. My own pursuit of scholarly responsibility through engagement may be described as a bal- anced academic career, with equal emphasis on research, teaching, practice, and service (Chen, 2010).10 As well as being involved in the Acad- emy of Management since my doctoral studies, I have made ambicultural efforts part of my scholarly mission to bridge gaps between East and West, research and teaching, and scholar- ship and practice. These initiatives include the Chinese Management Scholars Community and various activities, such as scholar mentorship, in China and other parts of the world; the Global Chinese Business Initiative; the International Conference on Competitive Dynamics; and the Wangdao Management Program. Below I look at some of these experiences. Academy of Management Without question, the most gratifying honor of my professional life was election in 2009 to the presidency of the Academy of Manage- ment for the 2012-2013 term. Through this ser- vice I was given a unique opportunity to put my ambicultural commitment into practice at the intellectual and organizational levels in 10 For adopting this research-practice-teaching emphasis, I am indebted to my former colleagues and mentors at Co- lumbia, including Donald C. Hambrick, Kathy R. Harrigan, Michael Tushman, and Joel Brockner, during the "imprint- ing" stage of my career.

Accordingly, companion articles in the Academy of Man- agement Perspectives (Chen & Miller, 2010, 2011) sketched out the East-West theme oí my presidency and advanced the idea oí ambicul- tural management and the related concept oí relational perspective. The 2011 conference. As program chair of the 2011 Academy annual conference, in San Anto- nio, Texas, I chose as the theme "West Meets East: Enlightening, Balancing, and Transcend- ing." The topic focused on the need for organi- zations, managers, and scholars from different countries and cultural backgrounds to become enlightened about balancing differences and transcending divides. More important, I hoped to highlight the ambicultural promise of not only transcending but synthesizing opposites. The il- lustration for the meeting program (Figure 2), with Shanghai reflected in New York, symbol- izes my view of the potential for ambicultural integration. The 2011 All- Academy Theme Chair, Harvard University's Jan Rivkin, elaborated this idea in the call for submissions: The theme offers two related interpretations. At one level, the theme invites us to examine . . . the implications of the East's (re)emergence for busi- ness leaders, management scholars, and the Academy itself. At a deeper level, . . . how can business leaders and scholars gain enlighten- ment from the contrasts we inevitably encounter in management? How can we achieve balance between opposites? How can we transcend an- tithesis and draw strength from differences? At the Sunday morning opening of the confer- ence, Jan and I turned tradition on its head and engaged the Academy community in a town hall conversation centered on this question: "As a researcher and a teacher, what can you do to get the best, and avoid the worst, from West meet- ing East?" Our goal in asking this question was to raise ambicultural awareness among Acad- emy members and to spark greater expansive- ness in management research.11 11 This community brainstorming also set the stage for an Academy of Management Journal special forum (guest ed- ited by Harry Barkema, Xiao-Ping Chen, Gerard George, Yadong Luo, and Anne Tsui), which is scheduled for publi- cation in 2014.

The Academy is now at a crossroads, with three forces converging: rapid growth, which requires professional manage- ment within the context of a long-standing cul- ture of volunteerism; the relevance and profes- sional impact of scholarship in society; and the pressure and opportunity to grow internation- ally in such a way that academic colleagues and institutions around the globe do not per- ceive expansion as intellectual imperialism. Consider the Academy's membership composi- tion during 2013 and it becomes clear why "West meets East" has special meaning at this junc- ture. Membership has grown by more than 60 percent over the past twelve years, with nearly 47 percent of the 19,000-some members and 40 percent of divisional leaders spread across 109 different countries outside North America. Exhibit 3 displays the increasing inter- national makeup of the Academy in member- ship and divisional leadership from 2001 to 2013 (a trend that did not occur in the Board of Gov- ernors until 2010).12 Like most large, multinational organizations, the Academy finds itself facing unique global challenges. At the most fundamental level, how will demographic shifts within the organization reshape the management profession and schol- arly pursuits? What questions does global ex- pansion raise about differences in research and teaching missions, as a result of different con- ceptions of scholars and teachers? Will we, as Academy members, be bystanders or construc- tive contributors to the debate on critical busi- ness issues of global significance? Going a step further, the Academy, despite its success and growth, faces not only issues of globalization but a number of ambicultural challenges. How can we, as academic and prac- titioner members of the Academy, balance a rich tradition and legacy of volunteerism with the need now for the Academy to "professionalize" or take a business development orientation?13 How can we help the organization fulfill its po- 12 The Academy has twenty-three divisions and two inter- est groups.

In 2013, for the first time in its seventy-three-year history, the Academy convened a conference outside North America, in Johannesburg, South Africa (and sponsored faculty development workshops in Ghana and Rwanda). Later in the year, a full day of the Academy's annual meeting was devoted to a first-ever Teaching and Learning Conference (TLC).14 Programs such as these are emblematic of a forward-looking mission for the twenty-first century. Africa Conference revisited. A core group of visionaries and doers was responsible for mak- ing the dream of a symposium in Africa a reality (see Appendix A). Two of the coleaders offered some reflections on the conference in an inter- view for this article. Stella Nkomo (University of Pretoria) saw a global or ambicultural outcome from a "local" perspective: The conference helped move interest in Africa from the margins to the center and I believe AOM will continue to reap benefits in the form of in- creased participation by African scholars learning that took place in Africa was mutually constructed as non-African scholars heard ques- tions they had not previously engaged and Afri- can scholars were pushed to temper the strong attachment to the uniqueness of the context. Jim Walsh (University of Michigan) expressed symbolically the promise of ambiculturalism relative to the Academy's global challenge- opportunity15: What comes to mind is one of those iconic images of a farmer's field in the middle of a drought - a field of dirt mottled by the deep cracks that form as the ground dries. When I think of the divides and gaps in our world, I think of that kind of farmer's dry field. All we need is water for the cracks to close and our work to bear fruit. Our cracks and divides disappeared in Johannesburg when we connected to better understand and ad- dress the problems and opportunities we encoun- tered there.

The Academy must continue to look to its membership and to "movers and shakers," such as those behind the Africa and Teaching and Learning conferences. Figure 3 is a collage of pro- fessionals and volunteers who organized the 2011 annual meeting. This is the collective face of the Academy's future and the hope for global - and ambicultural - enterprise aspirations. Over the past two decades, the number of Chinese management doctoral students and graduates around the globe has steadily in- creased, keeping pace with the Academy's growth in international membership. These co- inciding trends have opened the door of oppor- tunity for a variety of initiatives designed to bridge the management scholarship gap be- tween East and West.16 Some of these are con- sidered here. Chinese Management Scholars Community (CMSC) Fostering young scholars and educators has been central to my professional activities since I had the privilege of serving in the Academy's Business Policy and Strategy Division doctoral consortium in 1995. Within the East-West con- text, what began as a developmental work- shop with 26 participants at the Academy's (2006) Atlanta conference has increased in size and membership annually, and in 2013 more than 200 members attended CMSC's annual 16 Many scholars have made notable East-West efforts over the past thirty years. Bill Newman, for instance, was one of four American scholars who traveled to China in 1984 to start executive and scholar development programs, and his commitment to advancing Chinese management educa- tion never wavered until his final days. Anne Tsui gave up her career in the United States and created the management department at Hong Kong University of Science & Technol- ogy in the mid 1990s, which invited many Western scholars to visit for extended periods of time. In 2002 Anne founded the International Association of Chinese Management Re- search (IACMR) and its journal, Management of Organiza- tional Review , with the explicit goal of bridging East and West to advance scholarship in the Chinese context. IACMR aspired to serve as a platform for convening scholars from the East (China) and West to exchange ideas and research, form collaborations, and partner and support each other. I was honored to attend IACMR's biennial conference in Hong Kong, in 2012, where I witnessed an inspiring gathering of scholars.

Many of these scholars have risen through the academic ranks to positions of leadership at universities around the world. Structured as an independent, open plat- form, CMSC offers mentoring programs and services to Chinese (or Chinese-speaking) management scholars interested in becoming balanced business academics and engaged scholars. The grassroots group of volunteer academics is linked by Eastern and Western interests and guided by a mission to "pass the baton1 ■ (*#). and, as such, it derives its core values from the "middle" or "zhong" (41) phi- losophy: integrity, independence, harmony, balance, dynamics, and integration. Exhibit 4 describes these values and conveys CMSC's ambicultural drive to integrate East and West and academia and practice. With the work- shop as its centerpiece, CMSC offers programs such as reunions and research and teaching forums at the Academy's annual meeting. As well as providing intellectual impetus and so- cial support, the community brings together kindred spirits linked by a global-local view. Moreover, it offers a template for those who work outside the mainstream or who are new to a large and diverse international academic organization such as the Academy. With CMSC-type programs, any group of eth- nic or minority professionals can make contribu- tions - an important consideration in light of the Academy's historically strong U.S. orientation.17 Notably, the flow is both West to East and East to 17 When I traveled overseas during my term as presi- dent - seventy-five years after the Academy's founding - I This content downloaded from              140.248.40.41 on Fri, 08 Aug 2025 14:46:56 UTC              All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms 130 Academy oí Management Review April EXHIBIT 4 Values of Chinese Management Scholars Community (CMSC) Our core values and guiding principles derive from the "middle" or "zhong" philosophy: integrity, harmony, balance, integration, dynamics, and independence. • Integrity : We value trust, honesty, excellence, and humanity. We strive to be academic professionals who live up to the expectations of both Chinese and Western societies and both academic and business communities. • Harmony : We stress sharing, mutual respect, reciprocity, and enduring relationships as essential for maintaining a nurturing and supportive community. • Balance : We embrace balance between the Chinese and Western worlds, between scholarship and practice, and between career and life. • Integration : We appreciate our cultural heritage and academic backgrounds, and feel we are in a unique position to bridge the gap between Chinese and Western cultures and practices. • Dynamics : We recognize the evolving nature of our community. We will grow together as a community, and we will adapt to the changing needs and expectations of our members as they advance in their careers. • Independence : We believe that full independence allows us to concentrate on serving our community members, to hear what they want, and to understand how best to serve them.

Other East-West Ambicultural Initiatives For eleven days in 1997, at the invitation of China's National MBA Education Advisory Com- mittee, I worked with a group of management professors from the fifty-four MBA programs in China at that time. This initiative was signifi- cant because the first Chinese MBA program had been founded only three years before. For most of these scholars, this was their first expo- sure to Western management education: the workshop was an early ambicultural interface between tried-and-true Western managerial know-how and Chinese entrepreneurial drive was often referred to as president of the American Academy of Management. (in academia and business).18 In light of the ad- vances in management in China since then, the 1997 workshop represents a harbinger of ambi- cultural learning in a broader global commu- nity. Of these two Chinese scholarly communi- ties, CMSC has adopted a global-local (or outside-inside) view, while the China-based group takes more of a local-global (or inside- outside) perspective. Since 2010, annual conferences in Greater China have explored the ambicultural promise of the competitive dynamics perspective. A de- cade earlier, the founding of the Global Chinese Business Initiative (GCBI) at Wharton gave shape to ambiculturalism as a concept and per- spective. From 1997 to 2001 GCBI staged symposia in China and the United States, sponsored visiting Chinese scholars, and convened forums and a speaker series for international business academ- ics and practitioners at Wharton and in New York. More recently, I worked with Stan Shih, founder of Acer Computer, on the Wangdao Management Program, a social enterprise for developing East- West- balanced business leaders and world-class global enterprises. (I explain the concept of "wangdao" in the Managerial Implications sec- tion, below.) Initiatives such as these are somewhat uncon- ventional, of course, lying outside the tradi- tional boundaries of the Academy; they are nei- ther scholarship- (at least from the prevailing academic viewpoint in the United States) or in- stitution-based teaching platforms nor direct Academy activities. But they share the spirit of the Africa Conference and reflect the Academy's increasing international diversification, mani- festing the promise of ambiculturalism. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH AND MANAGEMENT There is a process to becoming an ambicul- tural professional or organization. It requires 18 They are true "locals" in global or Western education and scholarship. A number of these academics are now leaders and educators at their respective institutions. In September 2013 in Beijing, on the same campus at Tsinghua University where the 1997 workshop was held, we convened a three-day reunion of this group of scholars, each of whom brought one of his or her junior colleagues. A China chapter of the CMSC has been created, and hosts for the next five years have been lined up.

It de- mands a capacious notion (to use the academic arena as an example) of what exactly it means to be a "scholar" and how a scholar should en- gage with others and with the professional com- munity and society at large. Undertaking this process of becoming ambicultural suggests a wealth of implications for research and man- agement. I consider these in turn. Research Implications A range of research studies in ambicultural- ism is possible. Fundamentally, scholars might consider the meaning of "ambiculturalism" and extended constructs, such as "ambicultural in- tegration," and determine what exactly defines an "ambicultural professional or organization." What is the conceptual distinction and connec- tion between ambiculturalism and other related concepts, such as biculturalism, multicultural- ism, holistic thinking, and ambidexterity? Mind- ful of studies of ambidextrous organizations (Smith & Tushman, 2005) and executives (Tush- man, Smith, & Binns, 2011), researchers might study, for instance, how ambicultural integra- tion can be applied to balance forms of oppos- ing organizational forces, such as innovation and tradition or flexibility and tight control, and overcome inertia within organizations. At the level of culture and organizational philosophy, researchers can investigate the idea of East- West integration as "disruptive innovation." In stakeholder management, what advan- tages can a firm gain by creating an organiza- tional culture combining diverse perspectives and practices that balance the needs of various stakeholders (Freeman, Harrison, Wicks, Par- mar, & de Colle, 2010)? Specifically, would it be possible to integrate the best of shareholder per- spective, customer orientation, and employee empowerment while avoiding the worst? How can the conventional opposites in interfirm be- havior - competition and cooperation - be inte- grated (Gnyawali & Madhavan, 2001)? In HR management, what advantages are there in de- veloping HR systems to attract global talent and balance local and global needs (Bird, Menden- hall, Stevens, & Oddou, 2010)? In ambidextrous learning, how might the ambicultural perspec- tive be incorporated into the study of explor- atory and exploitive learning behaviors in cross-border alliance or cooperation (Smith & Tushman, 2005)? Entrepreneurship researchers could explore the value of integrating a new venture and an established business, and in the study of family business, scholars might study how the best of Eastern and Western family business practices are or can be integrated (Miller & Le Breton-Miller, 2005). At the individual level, how can managers learn to integrate and embrace the opposites of different cultures and practices, and how can ambicultural managers be selected and devel- oped (Mok & Morris, 2012)? Who should "become ambicultural" - only managers or leaders of MNCs, or also IT professionals or marketers in large corporations, or all employees (Schüler, 2011)? What is the role of cultural context in the development of ambicultural orientation? How similar or different, for example, are a Chinese and Indian ambicultural manager or an Ameri- can and European ambicultural manager? What happens if a particular culture does not prepare a manager for ambicultural management (Chen & Miller, 2010)? Finally, in light of the changing makeup of the Academy community, scholarly progress on the global front should keep pace with the organi- zation's growth. Scholars should be encouraged to inject authentic managerial concepts from different parts of the world into the mainstream research, which continues to be U.S. oriented. The ambicultural integration of competitive dy- namics research provides a workable model for this pursuit. Managerial Implications Ambicultural organizations. The number of firms incorporating the ambicultural ethos and putting it into practice is increasing. Samsung, tlļe South Korean global conglomerate, has fused Western and Eastern managerial philoso- phies and practices and is a model of ambicul- tural management (Khanna, Song, & Lee, 2011). Lincoln Electric, a U.S.-based welding equip- ment manufacturer founded in the nineteenth century, provides another compelling example. The company's approach to ambicultural man- agement includes balancing internal competi- tion and cooperation, social welfare and individ- ual interest, and tradition and entrepreneurship. The Harvard case study of Lincoln Electric (Fast & Berg, 1975; Siegel & Larson, 2009) has long been This content downloaded from              140.248.40.41 on Fri, 08 Aug 2025 14:46:56 UTC              All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms 132 Academy of Management Review April one of my favorites (Chen & Miller, 2010), not only for the topic but because of the different ways students interpret it. Teaching the case to busi- ness executives in the United States, I have heard comments ranging from "This is the best form of capitalism" to "This company symbol- izes Japanese management." In contrast, teach- ing the case in China to executives at state- owned enterprises (SOEs) often elicits such comments as "This is the best example of a socialist enterprise," or they remark that Lincoln would have been an SOE in the 1960s or that it represents the ideal of an SOE today (and there are other interpretations as well: at a business forum in 2012 in Guangzhou, a senior executive from Israel said, "I have been following Lincoln Electric for almost twenty years, and I always think of it as a Jewish company!"). Ambicultural professionals. As with organiza- tions like Lincoln Electric, consummate ambicul- tural professionals (Chen & Miller, 2011) - or "enlightened" managers and scholars - are characterized by certain distinct traits. These include an openness to new ways of thinking, a capacity for transcending divisions by embrac- ing ideas and practices from other parts of the world, and an ability to see the wisdom and strength in other cultural and business para- digms, culminating in a deeper understanding of their own culture. Ambicultural professionals manifest perspectives and skills that allow them to work in any institution, region, or coun- try; demonstrate a lifelong drive to reach the pinnacles of their profession and of humanity; seek to balance social good and self-interest; and strive overall for a balanced, rewarding ca- reer and life. In extensive interviews with West- ern and Asian business leaders, Lynn Paine uncovered some of the noted attributes of ambi- cultural business professionals: "They are stra- tegic yet hands-on; disciplined yet entrepre- neurial; process-oriented yet sensitive to people; authoritative yet nurturing; firm yet flexible; and action driven yet circumspect" (2010: 104). The discrete but linked notions of ambicul- tural organization and ambicultural profes- sional can be both understood and synthesized through the Chinese philosophical ideal of "wangdao" (3Ī3S; Chen, 2011). This concept is based on the idea of balance or self-other inte- gration and the ideals of unity and success through morality rather than force. Profession- als personifying wangdao instill this ideal within their organizations through their actions, beliefs, and ideas. Visionary business execu- tives create an ambicultural environment in their organizations; four who stand out are Car- los Ghosn of Renault-Nissan Alliance, James Houghton of Corning, Ruimin Zhang of Haier, and Kazuo Inamori of Kyocera and Japan Air- lines. These leaders apply the essence of ambi- cultural thinking in their integrative, balanced, relational approach to management - a strategy for long-term success that benefits a greater "community" beyond the organization's stake- holder circles. CONCLUSION Ambiculturalism offers a framework for valu- ing other cultures and traditions. But it can only emerge if we have a thorough understanding of our own "culture" - our assumptions, values, foundational ethics, strengths, and shortcom- ings. Absent this, we can neither fully compre- hend nor value other cultures. The experiences I have reviewed in this article illustrate my path toward an ambicultural perspective. I hope they will serve as a model for other professionals and organizations interested in moving in this direction. In my case the study of Chinese classics in- grained in me at a young age an interest in learning about other cultures, and through these books I was able to reach a paradoxical balance of Eastern and Western views and practices.19 Seeking out "opposites" opened up opportuni- ties for both intellectual and personal progress. Such shifts in perspective are essential to the transition from seeing the scholar's work through a "job" or "career" prism - that is, as goal or outcome oriented - to a "learning- contribution" world view - one that is process oriented and envisions a spectrum of contribu- tions, be they scholarly or humane. To be truly ambicultural, take nothing for granted and take nothing personally; every in- cidence or observation that challenges assump- tions or runs counter to intuition or long-held 19 Even today, thirty years after leaving Taiwan, I still have Four Books on my bedside table (these are the four must-read books in Chinese classics: the Analects, Mencius, the Great Learning, and the Doctrine of the Mean). I read the books daily, and they provide me with enduring ambicul- tural inspiration and aspirations.

In my career ambicultural progression has led me to understand that man- agement is about dealing with paradox and ten- sion (Lewis, 2000; Poole & Van de Ven, 1989) and strategy is about integration and balance (Weis, 1996). In the larger context of my life, there has been a greater lesson: the process of becoming an ambicultural scholar or professional can help one to develop not only a successful ca- reer - a natural outcome, if not a goal in itself - but also a fruitful life. Thus, the motto I like to share with colleagues is "Put yourself into the process - research, publication, career, and life - and the process will carry you through." The idea that seemingly irreconcilable differ- ences can exist in harmony offers us a key for making the world smaller. Ambiculturalism - integration that transcends differences - is a blueprint for how we and the societies in which we live can advance peacefully, prosperously, and sustainably. At one level it is an everyday philosophy for academic professionals who seek to juggle teaching, research, service, and other activities; for management and organiza- tional scholars specifically, it suggests a well- spring of research ideas. At the highest level a balanced life and career may be achieved by striving to transcend the opposites or paradoxes encountered in daily life. Ultimately, my hope is that the ambicultural perspective may one day encompass ever-expanding circles, from aca- demic and business professionals to all of humanity. EPILOGUE: "SOCRATES MEETS CONFUCIUS" The Socratic approach that undergirds case study teaching is generally regarded as "West- ern" didacticism. Yet in the Confucian Analects we find striking similarities between the meth- ods of Confucius and Socrates, these two great philosophers from antiquity. At Darden, the So- cratic-Confucian instructional philosophy is the pedagogical approach, as I believe it is fair to say it is as well at Harvard and other institu- tions with a heavy emphasis on teaching. Thus, it was in this meeting of West and East in my workplace - academia - that I discovered yet another manifestation of ambicultural integration. When it came time to prepare my presidential speech for the 2013 Academy meeting at Lake Buena Vista, Florida, extending the Socratic- Confucian (or "Ted Koppel") approach seemed completely logical. The idea of community con- versations kept bubbling up. With a once-yearly opportunity to engage this most remarkable gathering of management academics and pro- fessionals from around the world, why not start a dialogue among hundreds rather than deliver a monologue? There were several reasons for thinking that rich ground could be mined through such an approach. As far as I knew, after attending more than twenty Academy annual meetings, a Q&A for- mat had never been attempted (although Jan Rivkin and I had warmed up a bit with this approach in the 2011 conference). For one sea- soned in classroom dialogues spawned through the Socratic-Confucian approach, I knew how rewarding such a session could be; opening the speech with questions directed first at individ- ual audience members and then to the whole assembly would be something fresh, and the possibilities for discoveries about ourselves as a diverse organization linked by common yet also different interests and aspirations were ex- citing. (Appendix B provides an abbreviated transcript of these questions.) In this vein, a new approach was very much in keeping with a theme of change that I hoped would be in the minds and on the lips of attendees throughout the conference, and be- yond. As discussed in this article, the Acad- emy had undertaken some evolutionary (some might say revolutionary) initiatives in the months prior. So an audience participation component to the president's speech was a logical continuation of the theme of change and, more important, inclusiveness. The con- cern for "all-in" participation is especially critical in light of the size of the conference (and the Academy as a whole). In fact, as pres- ident, I considered my role mainly to be the Academy's "chief community officer." Naturally (and dear to me), this style of pres- idential speech offered an opportunity to ad- vance the idea of ambiculturalism through conversation with fellow Academy members in a communal, light-hearted, participatory manner. At best, I hoped that disseminating the idea of transcending differences to bring together various voices, perspectives, ideas, and cultures could help light the way forward in a world that, even as it becomes smaller, is This content downloaded from              140.248.40.41 on Fri, 08 Aug 2025 14:46:56 UTC              All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms 134 Academy of Management Review April increasingly complex and interconnected. And, at the least, I hoped that I might give fellow Academy members some food for thought for future meetings! I was delighted to receive affirmation of my approach via Jim Walsh's observations on the Africa Conference. In Jim's words I see the So- cratic-Confucian ambicultural experience re- flected: "I was taught again what it means to persist and to be patient as you work toward a goal that matters ... I walk away from this ex- perience as optimistic as ever that dreams can come true." His remarks reminded me of the two words my late professor in Taiwan, Chan-Kuei Chiang (who held a Ph.D. in organizational so- ciology from the University of Michigan), wished me always to remember as I prepared to em- bark for the United States more than thirty years ago: determination and persis- tence. They have carried me along in my own ambicultural drive, and I will continue to en- courage academic and business professionals who are concerned about divides - cultural, societal, professional, or personal - to set out on this journey. We cannot know how far we might travel unless we take the first step and begin the process. Trust me, the ambicultural Odyssey, although often bumpy and challeng- ing, is rewarding and fun! APPENDIX A THE 2013 ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT AFRICA CONFERENCE: A GLOBAL-LOCAL INITIATIVE The Africa Conference was the product of years of effort, principally by an ambicultural team of five people dedicated to the Academy: Helena Barnard, of the Gordon Institute of Busi- ness Science (GIBS)AJniversity of Pretoria; Phil Mirvis, of Boston College; Kelly Mitchell, of the Academy of Management; Stella Nkomo, of the University of Pretoria; and Jim Walsh, of the Ross School of Business/University of Michigan. Following are excerpts from interviews with Stella Nkomo and Jim Walsh. What is the " one " outcome oí the Africa Confer- ence that is most important to the Academy? Nkomo. Prior to this event there has been a sense that AOM was not really reaching out to African management scholars. . . . The confer- ence helped move interest in Africa from the margins to the center, and I believe AOM will continue to reap benefits in the form of in- creased participation by African scholars in AOM. The conference also gave the Africa Acad- emy of Management the boost it needs to accel- erate its development and growth. Walsh. Despite the best of intentions, the in- ertial forces in our world can be quite strong. This conference, one unlike any I've ever at- tended, shows us that we can set our minds to do something completely new . . . and, in fact, do it. I know that the Academy has internalized the truth of that statement. What is the "one" outcome that is most important to the management profession in general? Nkomo. What is most relevant for the manage- ment profession is the opportunity we all had to gain an understanding of how context affects management questions and their possible reso- lution. As organizations around the world at- tempt to become truly global, I believe the knowledge generated from conferences like Jo- hannesburg can be beneficial. Walsh. Substantively, we made abstract scholarly opportunities and problems come alive in a very real sense for the 300 or so people who traveled to Johannesburg. . . . These 300 people came to know each other personally as they discovered together the challenges worthy of their sustained attention and commitment. These attendees will carry these insights and relationships into their lives, changing forever the work they do. What is the significance of the Africa Conference for helping build the Academy as an ambicul- tural organization that aims to bridge divides by taking the best from apparent opposites such as East and West , local and global , research and teaching , scholarship and service? Nkomo. The learning that took place in Africa was mutually constructed as non-African schol- ars heard questions they had not previously en- gaged and African scholars were pushed to tem- per the strong attachment to the uniqueness of the context.

To the extent that our differences are rooted in unique experiences, identities, and capabilities, well then, those differences just reflect the strengths that we bring to the table as we live our lives together. APPENDIX B SOME QUESTIONS ASKED AT THE ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT PRESIDENTIAL SPEECH, AUGUST 11, 2013 To the doctoral students and Academy newcom- ers in the audience : Why are you here? As an advocate and disci- plined follower of the power of "one" (Chen, 2012), I would like to ask, "What is your one' expectation for my speech today? What does 'being ambicultural' mean to you? Why should you care?" To the 2011 welcome breakfast and presidential speech attendees: Do you remember what the theme of that year's conference was ["West Meets East"]? What's the connection between the East-West theme and the idea of "being ambicultural"? Do you remember this slide ["New York Meets Shanghai"]? To Ed Freeman (Dar den/University of Virginia), 2013 Distinguished Educator Award: Ed, do you remember the other day you saw me walking to the parking lot holding two cups, one in each hand? [You commented on my "two- fisted drinking."] As it happened, as I always do, I had coffee in one hand and tea in the other [being East-West balanced!]. To Mike Tushman (Harvard Business School ), 2013 Distinguished Scholar Award : Do you remember the advice you gave to me at our first meeting, when I first joined Columbia in 1989, after Don Hambrick, the head of the strategy group at that time, assigned me to be reviewed by you semiannually? [You advised me to publish more in ASQ than in SM/.] As a "greenhorn" academic, I struggled mightily over the differences - even the tension - between ASQ and SAÍ/, and between organizational the- ory and strategic management [intellectual and interdisciplinary tension and reconciliation]. To Don Hambrick (Pennsylvania State Univer- sity ), my former Columbia colleague and mentor: Don, do you remember my first faculty meet- ing? The meeting was held at 3:07 p.m., after some bizarre changes which I cannot recall now. I was three minutes late, and you made a joke about my Taiwanese clock. Perhaps you did not know that the Chinese think about time on a very long-term basis. So ... by my reckoning, I was actually approximately three months early. [Different cultures have different conceptions of time.] To Paul Adler (Marshall School/University of Southern California), 2013 Conference Program Chair: What is the connection between this year's theme, "Capitalism in Question," and being am- bicultural? What is the relationship and connec- tion between market- and state-driven econo- mies (or capitalism and socialism)? How can we resolve the tension between the two?

### Controlled Vocabulary and Alias Mapping (Canonicalization)

- Use canonical labels for recurring constructs/measurements; map near-synonyms to the canonical `term` and record alternatives in `aliases`.
- Examples (non-exhaustive; prefer these canonical labels):
  - presence_of_a_star (aliases: ["star_presence", "star firm"])
  - innovative_productivity (aliases: ["patent-weighted productivity"])
  - innovative_leadership_among_non_star_scientists (aliases: ["innovative leadership"])
  - breadth_of_star_expertise (aliases: ["technological breadth of star"])
  - star_collaborative_strength (aliases: ["star’s collaborative strength"])
  - product_market_entry_rate (aliases: ["rate of product market entry", "product/future product market entry"])
  - competitor_diversity (aliases: ["diversity_of_multimarket_contact"])
  - guanxi_with_business_community (dimension)
  - guanxi_with_government_authorities (dimension)
- When the paper distinguishes guanxi dimensions, extract them as separate constructs and reflect hierarchy via `construct_dimensions`.

### Minimal Coverage and Coverage Report

- Aim for minimal coverage where applicable (justify exceptions in `coverage_report.reason`):
  - Quantitative: ≥ 10 constructs; ≥ 12 relationships; ≥ 6 measurements
  - Qualitative/Conceptual: ≥ 8 constructs; ≥ 2 relationships; measurements optional
  - Simulation/ABM/Modeling: include `Model_Result`-anchored relationships and key parameters; measurements optional
- If unmet, include a root-level `coverage_report` with counts (or "none_found") and a brief `reason`. Add `errors` such as "no_anchor_found", "insufficient_evidence" when applicable.

### Anchor Priority and Normalization

- Prioritize anchoring to: Hypothesis/Proposition IDs > Theorem/Proposition_Label > Model_Result > Core_Claim.
- Titles: extract verbatim paper title; exclude series labels (e.g., "Research Notes and Commentaries").
- Journal: output full official name as shown in the paper.
- DOI: remove the URL scheme; return `doi.org/...` or bare DOI string.
