# ROLE AND GOAL
You are an extremely meticulous, detail-oriented research analyst and knowledge engineer. Your sole task is to act as an information extraction engine, strictly following the provided JSON Schema to convert unstructured text from the provided academic paper into structured knowledge.

## CORE DIRECTIVES

1. **Fidelity to Source** - All information you extract must originate directly from the provided paper text. You are strictly forbidden from making inferences, guessing, or adding external knowledge. If information is not present, use `null` or an empty array `[]`
2. **Schema is Supreme** - Your output must be, and can only be, a single, valid JSON object that strictly conforms to the provided JSON Schema. Do not add any explanations, comments, or Markdown formatting outside the JSON object
3. **Comprehensive Coverage** - You must make your best effort to comprehensively scan the entire paper (from abstract to references) to ensure all required information is extracted without omission
4. **Titles and Journal Names** - For `paper_metadata.title`, extract the title verbatim exactly as it appears in the paper (preserve any prefixes/suffixes, punctuation, diacritics, and casing; do not drop or normalize anything). For `paper_metadata.journal`, extract the full official journal name exactly as shown in the paper (no abbreviations or variants; preserve punctuation and casing).
5. **DOI Formatting** - For `paper_metadata.doi`, if the DOI appears as a URL (e.g., `https://doi.org/10.1000/xyz123`), return everything after the URL scheme (remove `http://` or `https://`), e.g., `doi.org/10.1000/xyz123`. If a bare DOI string is present (e.g., `10.1000/xyz123`), return it as-is.

## MULTI-STEP CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT PROCESS

Execute the following tasks in strict sequence to ensure the completeness and accuracy of the extraction:

## SCOPE POLICY (Layered: Core + Secondary)

- Core scope (mandatory): ONLY extract constructs, relationships, and measurements that are explicitly tied to Hypotheses/Propositions or appear in clearly labeled "Hypothesis Development"/"Proposition" sections. Each extracted item MUST include an anchoring field to identify the hypothesis/proposition (see schema additions below).
- Secondary scope (allowed, minimal):
  - Measurements for the core constructs, even if described in Methods/Measures section, as long as they can be explicitly mapped back to a core construct.
  - Results that explicitly confirm or refute a specific hypothesis/proposition (Empirical_Result) and can be linked to its identifier.
- Out of scope: Exploratory/ancillary relationships, general literature review claims, or findings that are not clearly tied to a numbered/named hypothesis/proposition or its direct development.

### Phase 1: Initial Scan & Global Classification

1. Read the entire paper to understand its overall structure and purpose.
2. Extract the top-level metadata to populate the `paper_metadata` section.
3. **Crucially, classify the `research_type`** based on its methodology. Is it `Quantitative`, `Qualitative`, `Conceptual`, `Review`, `Meta-Analysis`, or `Mixed-Methods`?
4. **Identify Replication Study**: Determine if the paper is explicitly a `Replication Study` and set the `is_replication_study` boolean accordingly.

### Phase 2: Relationship-First Identification and Construct Harvesting (Core-only)

This is the most critical phase. Your primary goal is to find all relationship claims first, as this guarantees the capture of all relevant constructs.

1. **Systematic Search for Claims**: Meticulously scan the paper, focusing on the **Hypotheses, Hypothesis Development, Propositions, and Results sections**. Identify ONLY claims that belong to a Hypothesis or Proposition (including their development) or that explicitly confirm/refute them in Results.
2. **Harvest Constructs from Claims**: For **every single relationship claim** you identify, immediately extract all the construct `term`s mentioned within that claim (e.g., the subject, object, moderators, mediators).

   **CRITICAL RULE FOR CONSTRUCT NAMES:**
   - Extract ONLY the FULL construct name, NOT abbreviations in parentheses
   - **Examples of CORRECT extraction:**
     - ✅ "organizational commitment" (NOT "organizational commitment (OC)")
     - ✅ "network constraint" (NOT "network constraint (NC)")
     - ✅ "structural holes" (NOT "structural holes (SH)")
   - **Examples of INCORRECT extraction:**
     - ❌ "organizational commitment (OC)"
     - ❌ "network constraint (NC)"
     - ❌ "structural holes (SH)"
   - **Rule**: Remove ALL parenthetical abbreviations and keep only the complete construct name
   - **Global Application**: Apply the same rule to ALL terms (constructs, moderators, mediators, controls) AND to measurement names. Examples:
     - ✅ "distance" (NOT "distance (d)")
     - ✅ "return on assets" (NOT "return on assets (ROA)")
     - ✅ "research and development intensity" (NOT "R&D intensity")

   **CRITICAL RULE FOR DETAILED EXTRACTION:**
   - **Definitions must be comprehensive**: Extract the FULL definition, not just a brief mention
   - **Context must be rich**: Include enough context so someone unfamiliar with the paper can understand the concept
   - **Examples**: If the paper provides examples, include them in the definition
   - **Operational details**: Include how the construct is operationalized or measured
   - **Boundary conditions**: Extract any limitations or conditions mentioned for the construct
   - **Measurements must be detailed**: Include complete measurement procedures, scales, formulas, and validation details

   **CRITICAL RULE FOR CONSTRUCT SELECTION:**
   - **ONLY extract theoretical constructs** that appear in propositions, hypotheses, or theoretical frameworks
   - **Include related measurements** ONLY for those constructs mentioned in hypotheses/propositions
   - **Include control variables** ONLY when they have clear theoretical justification and are explicitly tied to the hypotheses/propositions
   - **Examples of what NOT to extract**: "p-value", "sample size", standalone mathematical parameters not framed as constructs
   - **Examples of what TO extract**: "modularity", "network constraint", "structural holes", "organizational commitment"
3. **Compile a Master List (Core Anchored)**: Create a master list of all construct `term`s harvested from the core claims only. For each item, capture the hypothesis/proposition identifier when available (e.g., `H1`, `H1a`, `P2`).

### Phase 3: Construct De-duplication, Dimension Identification & Definition Search

1. **De-duplicate**: Create a unique set of construct `term`s from the master list compiled in Phase 2.
2. **Identify Dimensions**: Re-examine the paper, especially the literature review and theory sections. If the paper describes a construct (e.g., "Organizational Justice") as being composed of multiple dimensions (e.g., "Distributive Justice," "Procedural Justice"), you must capture these hierarchical links and populate the `construct_dimensions` array.
3. **Targeted Definition Search**: For **each unique term**, now go back through the paper and search for its most explicit, verbatim `definition` and `context_snippet`.

   **CRITICAL - Detailed Definition Extraction:**
   - **Definitions must be comprehensive**: Extract the FULL definition, not just a brief mention
   - **Context must be rich**: Include enough context so someone unfamiliar with the paper can understand the concept
   - **Examples**: If the paper provides examples, include them in the definition
   - **Mathematical notation**: If the construct involves mathematical formulas or parameters, extract them completely
   - **Operational details**: Include how the construct is operationalized or measured
   - **Boundary conditions**: Extract any limitations or conditions mentioned for the construct
4. **Populate Constructs Array**: Populate the `constructs` array in the final JSON with every unique term and its found definition. If a term involved in a relationship has no explicit definition, it **must** still be included in this array (its `definition` field can be `null`).

### Phase 4: In-depth, Methodology-Aware Relationship Characterization

Now, return to the relationship claims identified in Phase 2 and characterize them in detail.

1. **Identify General Properties**:
   - Clearly identify the `subject_term` and `object_term`.
   - Determine the `status`: is it a `Hypothesized` claim or an `Empirical_Result`?
   - Find any `supporting_theories`, `moderators`, and `mediators`.
   - **Extract Boundary Conditions**: Extract any `boundary_conditions` the authors set for the hypothesis or finding (e.g., "only in high-tech industries").
   - **Extract Replication Outcome**: If the paper is a replication study, determine and extract the `replication_outcome` for key relationships (`Successful`, `Failed`, or `Mixed`).

2. **Branch Extraction by Evidence Type**:
   - **If the evidence is Quantitative**:
     - Set `evidence_type` to `Quantitative`.
     - Extract `effect_direction`, `non_linear_type`, `is_meta_analysis`, `is_validated_causality`.
     - Additionally, populate `causal_support_level`, `design_type`, `manipulated_variable`, and optional `causal_notes` for each specific subject→object relationship.
     - Leave qualitative fields as `null`.
   - **If the evidence is Qualitative**:
     - Set `evidence_type` to `Qualitative`.
     - Extract the `qualitative_finding` and `supporting_quote`.
     - Leave all quantitative fields as `null`.

   **STRICT RULES for Moderators and Non-linear Effects**:
   - Moderators: Only extract a variable as a moderator when the paper explicitly labels it as a moderator or clearly claims a moderating effect (e.g., "X moderates the relationship between A and B", "we test moderation by X"). Do not infer moderators from generic interaction terms unless explicitly described as moderation by the authors.
   - Non-linear Effects: Only set `effect_direction` to a non-linear category or `non_linear_type` when the paper explicitly states a form (e.g., "U-shaped", "inverted U-shaped", "S-shaped", "curvilinear with U-shape"). The mere presence of polynomial terms or curvature tests without explicit labeling must NOT be treated as non-linear.

### Phase 5: Measurement Extraction (Secondary allowed to support Core)

For constructs that are operationalized in the methodology section, extract their specific `measurement` methods ONLY if they map directly to a core-scoped construct (from Phases 2–4). Ensure explicit mapping from measurement to the construct and, when applicable, to the linked hypothesis/proposition identifier.

**CRITICAL - Comprehensive Measurement Extraction:**
- **Extract complete measurement procedures**: Include step-by-step operationalization details
- **Include measurement scales**: Extract the specific scales, questionnaires, or instruments used
- **Mathematical formulas**: If measurements involve formulas or calculations, extract them completely
- **Validation details**: Include reliability, validity, and other psychometric properties mentioned
- **Examples of items**: If the paper provides sample questionnaire items, include them
- **Scoring procedures**: Explain how responses are converted to construct scores
- **Context-specific details**: Include any industry-specific or context-specific measurement adaptations

## Theory Extraction (Core-only)

Goal:
Extract only the theories that explicitly ground the paper’s core claims. Exclude background/literature-survey theories that are not used to justify the core arguments.

Inclusion (must satisfy ALL):
- The theory is explicitly used to justify a core claim.
- The claim is anchored to one of the following (ordered by strength):
  1) Hypothesis / Proposition with identifier (e.g., H1, H1a, P2)
  2) Formal label: Theorem / Proposition / Lemma / Corollary (e.g., T1, P1, L1, C1)
  3) Model Result (e.g., “Result 1”, “We show that…”, “The model predicts that…”)
  4) Core Claim sentence (e.g., “we propose/argue/show/predict that…”, “it follows that…”, “implies that…”)
- Provide at least one textual anchor: section_header and/or a short context_snippet containing the grounding phrase (e.g., “drawing on”, “based on”, “grounded in”).
- Do NOT include theories mentioned only as prior work without being used to justify a core claim.

Strict rules:
- Name hygiene: output the full theory name only; drop parenthetical abbreviations (e.g., use “resource-based view”, not “RBV (resource-based view)”).
- Origin source: set origin_source to one of Hypothesis | Proposition | Hypothesis_Development | Results-Confirming | Theorem | Proposition_Label | Model_Result | Core_Claim
- Claims linkage: 
  - If H/P is available, set hypothesis_id (e.g., H1, H1a, P2).
  - Always set claim_id (stable id) for the core claim (e.g., H1/H1a/P2/T1/Result1/CC1). If no author label exists, generate CC1/CC2… in reading order.

Smith * Curtis M. Grimm North Carolina State University, College of Management, Raleigh, North Carolina 27695-7229 University of Maryland at College Park, College of Business and Management, College Park, Maryland 20742 University of Maryland at College Park, College of Business and Management, College Park, Maryland 20742 Abstract Drawing on the Austrian school of economics and the struc- ture-conduct-performance (s-c-p) paradigm of industrial or- ganization, the authors present and test a dynamic model of competitive activity and performance. They examine the model in two stages. First, they explore the influence of industry-level and firm-level cooperative mechanisms on firm-level competitive activity. Second, they examine the ef- fect of firm- and industry-level competitive activity on firm performance. The authors use the dynamic model of competitive activity to examine the complex linkages between the firm's environ- ment, its actions, and its performance outcomes. They report a longitudinal analysis of a sample of 1,903 competitive moves undertaken in the software industry. Hypothesis test- ing supports the relationships in the model argued from the Austrian perspective, but provides only partial support for those derived from the s-c-p paradigm. Firm-level coopera- tive mechanisms are found to increase the firm's competitive activity, and firm-level competitive activity is related posi- tively to the firm's return on assets and return on sales. Contrary to expectation based on the s-c-p paradigm, indus- try-level cooperative mechanisms are not related to the firm's competitive activity or to its performance. Consistent with the IO paradigm, however, a measure of industry rivalry that directly captures industry-level competitive activity is related negatively to firm-level performance. (Austrian Economics; Dynamic Strategy; Hypercompeti- tion; Industrial Organization Economics; Inter-firm Co- operation; Performance) That firm-level competitive action is at the core of business strategy and competitive positioning is well accepted (Chen et al. 1992, Mintzberg 1978, Porter 1980: ch. 5; Thompson and Strickland 1993: 77). In- deed, the dynamic strategy research stream focuses on the relationship between competitive action and com- petitive advantage (e.g., Bettis and Weeks 1987, Chen et al. 1992, MacMillan et al. 1985, Smith et al. 1992). The more recent hypercompetition concept builds on that dynamic view of strategy to address market envi- ronments characterized by extremely vigorous competi- tive action, in which sustainability of competitive ad- vantage depends on the speed of action and the extent of competitive rivalry (D'Aveni 1994: 217). Dynamic firm-level competitive action in hypercom- petitive environments has three important characteris- tics. First, competitive advantage is short lived because frequent aggressive firm-level action disrupts causal linkages between competitive conduct and perfor- mance outcomes established in the market status quo. Second, firms must undertake series of actions to con- tinuously recreate competitive advantage. Finally, in a hypercompetitive marketplace, firms with more com- petitive activity theoretically will have superior perfor- mance over time in relation to rivals with less activity (D'Aveni 1994: 12, 258, 364). The key role of firm-level action in the hypercompet- itive market is consistent with the emphasis on market processes described by the Austrian school of eco- nomics (see, e.g., Jacobson 1992, Kirzner 1976, 1979, 1992, Schumpeter 1934). According to Austrian eco- nomics, organizational action (1) constitutes the critical market process, (2) can disrupt linkages between com- petitive conduct and performance found in the status quo of the marketplace, and (3) can convert otherwise neglected opportunity to the advantage of the acting organization, and by diffusion to the larger market- place. The focus on organizational action and its role in market processes is a major contribution of the Aus- trian school that has informed the dynamic strategy 1047-7039/96/0703/0243/$01.25 Copyright ? 1996.

SMITH AND CURTIS M. GRIMM "Austrian" and Industrial Organization Perspectives research stream (Smith et al. 1992: 4) as well as the hypercompetition concept (D'Aveni 1994: 365). The strategy literature, however, has largely failed to sub- ject the Austrian approach to critical empirical exami- nation (Jacobson 1992: 784). Moreover, theoretical tension between the Austrian school and the structure-conduct-performance (s-c-p) paradigm of in- dustrial organization (Bain 1951), a well-researched root discipline of the strategy field, lends urgency to the task of testing the propositions of the Austrian school. The tension between the s-c-p paradigm and the Austrian school arises from the common focus of the two perspectives, namely the linkages between the market environment, competitive conduct, and perfor- mance outcomes. The perspectives diverge in several respects, but two important differences paramount to our present research concern (1) competitive conduct outcomes arising from cooperative mechanisms be- tween rivals, and (2) performance outcomes expected from competitive conduct. Drawing from the Austrian school, D'Aveni (1994: 333-341) argues that in hypercompetition firms use horizontal cooperative mechanisms, or relationships with rivals for mutual benefit (e.g., joint product devel- opment, joint distribution, product licensing), as a means to escalate their individual competitive activity. Conversely, according to the s-c-p tradition, horizontal cooperative mechanisms create interfirm linkages that allow reduction of rivalrous behavior (Stigler 1964). According to D'Aveni (1994), firms in a hypercom- petitive environment must undertake frequent compet- itive activity over time to create and recreate competi- tive advantage. A well-established stream of 10 litera- ture (see Scherer and Ross 1990), argued from the industry level of analysis, supports the opposite view that high levels of competitive conduct lead to lower performance of firms within an industry. The theoretical tension between the Austrian school and the traditional industrial organization paradigm warrants efforts toward resolution. We examine the influence of horizontal cooperative mechanisms on firm-level competitive activity, and the relationship be- tween firm-level competitive activity and performance outcomes. More specifically, we propose a dynamic model of competitive activity that relates cooperative mechanisms and competitive action at both the firm and industry levels of analysis and describes firm-level performance as a function of those multilevel dimen- sions. A sample of 1,903 competitive moves undertaken over a nine-year period in the U.S. software industry Figure 1 Dynamic Model of Competitive Activity INDUSTRY-LEVEL INDUSTRY-LEVEL COOPERATION RIVALRY FIRM-LEVEL PERFORMANCE FIRM-LEVEL FIRM-LEVEL COOPERATIVE COMPETITIVE MECHANISMS ACTIVITY was used to test our model. As suggested by D'Aveni (1994: 2), competitive conduct in the U.S. software industry provides a uniquely comprehensive view of the way competitors act to build their own advantage. A Dynamic Model of Competitive Activity We introduce a dynamic model of competitive activity that explicitly treats firm-level competitive action as a consequence of firm participation in cooperative mech- anisms and as an antecedent of firm performance, within the larger context of industry cooperation and rivalry. The model, depicted in Figure 1, thus incorpo- rates cooperative and competitive aspects of firm-level action with comparable concepts of cooperation and competition at the industry level. In Figure 1 we inten- tionally omit relationships between firm- and industry- level cooperation and between firm- and industry-level cooperation and industry-level rivalry and firm-level performance. We control for those relationships in hypothesis testing. Our research segments conduct into two compo- nents, the cooperative and competitive activity of the individual firm and the cooperative and competitive activity of that firm's rivals (referred to as industry cooperation and competitor rivalry). Our focus, as rep- resented by the arrows in Figure 1, is on the influence of firm- and industry-level cooperation on firm-level competitive activity and the influence of firm- and industry-level competitive activity on firm-level perfor- mance. The multilevel framework allows integration of the Austrian school with the structure-conduct-perfor- 244 ORGANIZATION SCIENCE/VO1. 7, No. 3, May-June 1996 This content downloaded from              146.75.174.29 on Fri, 08 Aug 2025 15:27:50 UTC              All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms GREG YOUNG, KEN G. SMITH AND CURTIS M. GRIMM "Austrian" and Industrial Organization Perspectives mance paradigm from 10 economics. Importantly, the s-c-p paradigm treats the industry as the primary unit of analysis, whereas in our present model primary attention is on the individual firm. The change of focus from industry conduct to individual-firm activity is con- sistent with recent development in 10 theory. For example, game-theoretic techniques that model rivalry have applied industry-level theory to the examination of competitive conduct at the firm level (Fraas and Greer 1977, Saloner 1991), providing additional sup- port for the disaggregate perspective. Porter (1981) noted the shift in the unit of analysis in industrial organization research to include both the firm and the industry. That development should not be theoretically surprising, as the importance of market structure is that it induces firm-level conduct (Caves 1972). Firm-level competitive activity is defined here as the total number of competitive actions a firm takes in a given year. That approach is consistent with D'Aveni's (1994), as well as with 10 literature suggesting that competitive actions among industry incumbents are the fundamental core of competitive conduct (Caves 1984, Porter 1980). Drawing on literature concerning com- petitive moves and advantage (Caves 1984, D'Aveni 1994, Khandwalla 1981, Pennings 1981, Porter 1980, Salop and Scheffman 1983, Schmalensee 1978), we consider competitive activity to include product intro- ductions and announcements, as well as marketing and promotion campaigns (including price cuts). We define the level of competitive activity in the industry (industry-level rivalry) as the aggregation of firm-level competitive activity minus the competitive activity of the focal firm. When the number of competi- tive actions between all firms in the industry is high, rivalry will be intense. Our definition is consistent with the 10 literature suggesting that rivalry be framed as a sequence of competitive moves among industry incum- bents (Caves 1984, Porter 1980). Rivalry has been simi- larly defined in several recent studies (Schomburg et al. 1994, Smith et al. 1992). We define firm-level cooperative mechanisms to be formal interfirm agreements including equity pur- chases, mergers, technology licenses, and participa- tion in trade associations and technology consortia (Bresser 1988, Dollinger 1990, Harrigan 1985, Koh and Venkatraman 1991). That definition focuses on the linkages between organizations over which flow com- munication and resources. We recognize that some types of cooperative mechanisms may be difficult to distinguish from competitive action. For example, a cooperative mechanism may position a focal firm in some hybrid organization to compete in a broader scope of product-markets. The purpose of our article, however, is to examine the contrasting arguments about the relationship between horizontal interfirm linkages and competitive activity. Hence, it is important to focus on the theoretical distinction between the two con- structs. In the 10 tradition, according to the s-c-p paradigm, the proliferation of cooperative mechanisms between all firms in an industry is an important dimension of industry structure (Bain 1951, Stigler 1964). We define the level of cooperative mechanisms in the industry (industry-level cooperation) as simply the aggregation of firm-level cooperative mechanisms minus those of the focal firm. That is, when the number of cooperative mechanisms involving firms in an industry is high, the level of industry cooperation will tend to be high. The model depicted in Figure 1 thus reflects both the firm-level emphasis of the Austrian school and the industry-level focus of the industrial organization per- spective. In the next section we develop hypotheses describing the relationships portrayed in Figure 1 in more detail. The hypotheses specify how, within the context of industry cooperation and competitor rivalry, the cooperative activity of the firm will influence its competitive activity, and how the firm's competitive activity will in turn influence its performance. Hypotheses The Influence of Industry- and Firm-level Cooperative Mechanisms on Firm-Level Competitive Activity Cooperative mechanisms are actions of one firm that form connections or coalitions with other firms in the industry (Porter 1980: 88, 1985: 57). The consequences of cooperation differ with the level of analysis (industry vs. firm). As is consistent with the s-c-p paradigm of the 10 tradition and the industry level of analysis, we expect cooperative mechanisms to provide opportunities for industry participants to communicate and to learn about each other's goals and incentives (Stigler 1964). Scherer and Ross (1990) argued that firms can move their industry in the direction of greater overall indus- try cooperation by increasing the level of industry communication. One mechanism for achieving such communication is cooperative agreements between firms. Hence, as the number of cooperative agreements between firms in the industry increases, the ease of communication between firms would increase and the resultant social structure of the industry would become more cooperative.

SMITH AND CURTIS M. GRIMM "Austrian" and Industrial Organization Perspectives The proliferation of cooperative mechanisms at the industry level increases opportunities for informal col- lusion or tacit cooperation between firms (Bresser 1988, Oster 1990, Stigler 1964) and decreases the vulnerabil- ity of firms to threats from competitor rivalry. As a result, firms can establish higher prices and achieve higher performance from any given portfolio of com- petitive activity than would otherwise be possible (Koh and Venkatraman 1991, Nielsen 1988, Scherer and Ross 1990: 213, 226). Further, formal coopera- tive agreements in an industry serve as rules for behav- ior that make competitiveness more predictable (Gottfredson and White 1981), thereby reducing the firm's risk associated with expected returns from com- petitive activity. Thus, in a cooperative industry con- text, firms can achieve performance objectives with fewer competitive actions than would be necessary in a less cooperative environment. Hi. As the number of industry-level horizontal coop- erative mechanisms increases, finn-level competitive activ- ity decreases. Our expectation in HI is that the industrywide pro- liferation of cooperative mechanisms will constrain or have a negative influence on each firm's competitive activity. In contrast, consistent with the Austrian per- spective, we expect firm-level cooperative mechanisms to have a positive impact on each participant's ten- dency to undertake competitive activity (D'Aveni 1994, Kirzner 1976: 85, Rizzo 1982: 58-59). Horizontal coop- erative mechanisms give participants access to both tangible and intangible complementary resources, in- cluding knowledge, technology, and/or physical assets (Koh and Venkatraman 1991, Mariti and Smiley 1983, Nielsen 1988). For example, a firm with strong product development skills but relative weakness in marketing may license its innovative products to a competitor with distribution strengths. As Lenz (1980: 228) has argued, firm-level competi- tive activity is a function not only of the resources a firm directly owns, but also of resources it can access from relationships and interactions with other organi- zations in its environment. Cooperative mechanisms provide means whereby participating firms can com- pete for position more economically than firms that must acquire resources unilaterally. Thus, cooperative mechanisms enable each participant to undertake more competitive activity than is possible with the resources accessible to any participant alone (D'Aveni 1994: 338, Koh and Venkatraman 1991, Lenz 1980: 228, Mariti and Smiley 1983, Nielsen 1988). H2. As the number of horizontal cooperative mecha- nisms in which a firm participates increases, competitive firn activity increases. Following the dynamic model in Figure 1, we next develop hypotheses addressing the influence of indus- try- and firm-level competitive activity on firm perfor- mance. The Influence of Industry Rivalry and Firm-level Competitive Activity on Firm-level Performance Framing firm performance as a consequence of firm action is consistent with 10 literature suggesting that rivalry be framed as a sequence of competitive actions among industry incumbents (Caves 1984, Porter 1980). Importantly, the s-c-p paradigm of 10 posits that the conduct of firms in an industry will in turn affect performance. Researchers in that tradition, however, usually infer rather than directly measure rivalry (Porter 1981). According to the s-c-p paradigm of 10 economics, an industry characterized by high levels of rivalrous com- petitive conduct has negative consequences for firm performance. Intense rivalrous competition in an in- dustry can drive up the acquisition costs of scarce resources or spur suppliers to extend distribution to rivals (Barney 1991, Mahoney and Pandian 1992, Peteraf 1993). In addition to competition for resources, there may be competition for product/market posi- tioning as rivals attempt to respond to or deter compet- itive action. The 10 perspective is that firm-level activity may provoke industry rivalry that dissipates potential per- formance outcomes in a competitive battle. Strategy scholars also have used game theoretic formulations of the prisoners' dilemma model to demonstrate that high levels of rivalry lead to low profits for competitors (Bettis and Weeks 1987, Porter 1980, Schomburg et al. 1994, Smith et al. 1992). Too much activity, in the aggregate, hurts firm-level performance. In short, the level of industry rivalry affects prof- itability prior to strategy implementation (ex ante) by increasing the costs of resource acquisition and affects it after implementation (ex post) by increasing the cost of defending against product/market rivals. Thus, the threat of competitive retaliation reduces the expected benefit associated with competitive action, thereby re- ducing the profit incentive to undertake competitive activity (Astley and Fombrun 1983, Khandwalla 1981, Scherer and Ross 1990, Stigler 1964). 246 ORGANIZATION SCIENCE/VOl. 7, No. 3, May-June 1996 This content downloaded from              146.75.174.29 on Fri, 08 Aug 2025 15:27:50 UTC              All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms GREG YOUNG, KEN G. SMITH AND CURTIS M. GRIMM "Austrian" and Industrial Organization Perspectives A rich array of 10 empirical studies have found inferential support for that notion by showing a posi- tive linkage between industry concentration and indus- try profitability (Scherer and Ross 1990: 422-423). Although the degree of rivalry was not measured di- rectly in those studies, the s-c-p paradigm implies that high concentration produces lower levels of rivalry and thereby higher profits. A more recent line of strategy research has opera- tionalized the conduct construct, affording a direct test of the relationship between rivalry and performance. Schomburg et al. (1994) found a negative relationship between rivalry, defined as the frequency of new prod- uct introductions by industry participants, and prof- itability in the beer, telecommunications, and personal computer industries. Similarly, Smith et al. (1992) demonstrated that competitor rivalry, defined in terms of the frequency of competitive action, was related negatively to industry profitability in the airline indus- try. H3. The greater the level of industry-level competitive activity, the lower the firm-level performance. D'Aveni (1994: 10-12) argues that, in a hypercom- petitive environment, firm performance is an outcome of a series of competitive actions. That conceptualiza- tion is consistent with the Austrian school, which em- phasizes that opportunity for profit is the most impor- tant incentive for a firm to undertake competitive action (Kirzner 1976, 1979, 1992, Schumpeter 1934). The Austrian school's emphasis on aligning the firm's action with opportunity is well accepted in the strategy field (e.g., SWOT analysis). "Austrian" roots also are evident in the hypercompetition perspective of a firm's performance as an outcome of a series of competitive actions (D'Aveni 1994: 10-12). For example, product introductions and marketing moves are typical strategic thrusts that companies use to seize the initiative in their markets (see Porter 1980: 159, Schomburg et al. 1994), whereas product announcements can create market disruption by unsettling opponents (D'Aveni 1994: 279). Competitive activity of the firm creates internal or- ganizational assets in the form of skills, routines, and knowledge as well as assets that cross the organiza- tional boundary such as contracts, relationships, brand images, and networks (Nelson and Winter 1982: 99, Porter 1991: 102). Maintaining or enhancing the pro- ductive asset base of the firm requires undertaking activities (Porter 1991: 103). In building on asset Figure 2 A Series of Competitive Actions Adds to a Firm's Total Performance Outcome (adapted from D'Aveni 1994: 12) PROFIT FROM SERIES OF FIRM'S ACTIONS etc. TIME strengths, the cost of taking action is lower for the firm that has efficiencies derived from a rich history of prior activity. Importantly, the firm with a rich history of activity-derived learning not only has lower costs of supporting superior performance, but also is capable of undertaking more activities in a given time period. To illustrate the beneficial effect of undertaking more action in a given period of time, Figure 2, adapted from D'Aveni (1994: 12), portrays a series of firm-level actions and their associated cumulative profitability over time. Reflecting the arguments of the Austrian school, each trapezoid in Figure 2 represents a firm's action to exploit a specific opportunity, and its volume represents profits earned by the firm for having acted to seize that opportunity. The greater the number of trapezoids (actions) and the larger their volume (profits), the greater the firm's performance over time. In a hypercompetitive environ- ment, the erosion of profit for each action (the declin- ing right leg of each trapezoid) comes very soon in time. Thus, in a hypercompetitive industry, the firm that undertakes more actions generates a higher level of performance. We summarize the preceding discus- sion in the form of a testable hypothesis. H4. As competitive firm activity increases, firm per- formance increases. Methods To test the hypothesized relationships, we constructed a dataset for publicly owned firms in the computer software industry (SIC 7371, 7372, 7373) from two sources. In building the sample, we used information on individual firms, industry structure affecting all firms, and longitudinal dynamics of competition.

SMITH AND CURTIS M. GRIMM "Austian" and Industrial Organization Perspectives Sample The sample consisted of publicly owned single-business firms in the U.S. computer software industry during the period from 1983 to 1991. Those years were forma- tive ones, for the software industry emerged from the computer hardware industry as a distinct market around 1980 (Standard and Poor's Industry Surveys 1977, 1980, 1984). As Fortune noted, "until the Eight- ies, the computer software business was dominated by vertically integrated companies ... that made every element of their products, from silicon to software" (Sherman 1993). Moreover, computer software is a singularly important domestic U.S. industry, one that sets the direction for the global computer industry (Manasian 1993). An example of the dominance of the U.S. industry is evident in Europe: of the top ten independent software vendors operating there, seven are U.S. firms (McCormick and Greenbaum 1992). Limiting the sample to firms primarily in a single industry ensures that all firms are exposed to the same environment, an important consideration in any strat- egy research. Unique industry characteristics may be critical in explaining the relationship among important variables (Hansen and Hill 1991), and the components of competitive advantage in one industry may not be appropriate in other industries characterized by differ- ent environments. For research on hypercompetition, it is extremely important not to sample unintentionally from more passive industry environments. For continuity over the period 1983 to 1991, we considered firms to be in the computer software indus- try if their primary SIC assignment was any of the computer software codes (7371, 7372, or 7373).1 Such an approach is consistent with the assumption in the literature that organizations in a four-digit standard industry category are horizontally interdependent and share one market (Kim et al. 1985, Palepu 1985, Pennings 1981: 434). We took a conservative approach to defining soft- ware firms and accepted only those identified by both the Standard and Poor's Corporate Directory and the Disclosure database of SEC filings. Firms for which the primary SIC assignments were in agreement in the two sources were accepted as a consensus list of firms in the computer software industry. That approach re- sulted in 365 firm-year observations for the period from 1983 to 1991. One firm was dropped from the sample because it appeared in only one year and reported accounting losses equal to more than six times sales. After we dropped 19 other firms because of missing data, the final sample consisted of 345 firm-year observations with 1,903 actions over the period 1983 to 1991. Notably, the final sample encompassed more than 63% of all industry sales for the 1983-1991 period (based on all 10-K and annual reports classified with the software SIC codes by Disclosure); hence, most of the industry economic activity was captured in the sample. In addition, annual firm profitability, quick ratio test of liquidity, and year-to-year industry growth did not differ significantly between the research sample and the industry norms published by Dun and Brad- street, as indicated by pairwise t-tests. We therefore concluded that the research sample was representative of the industry. Firm- and Industry-level Competitive Activity The focus of our study was on competitive firm activity. Our measure of firm activity followed the recent stream of strategy research on dynamic competition (Bettis and Weeks 1987, Smith et al. 1992), which has intro- duced a direct measure of competitive actions under- taken by the firm. Competitive actions were identified by a structured content analysis of published articles (Jauch et al. 1980), a technique used in other studies of dynamic strategy (e.g., Chen et al. 1992; Smith et al. 1991, 1992). We applied a comprehensive, multiple source method and examined citations of the sample firms appearing in the Predicasts F & S Index for the 1983-1991 pe- riod. We coded all cited moves of product introduc- tions, product announcements, and marketing/promo- tion campaigns, typical strategic thrusts that companies use to seize the initiative in their markets (e.g., see D'Aveni 1994: 279; Porter 1980: 17, 76; Schomburg, Grimm, and Smith 1994). Our method identified a total of 1,903 rivalrous ac- tions in the computer software industry for the 1983-1991 period. We selected a random subsample of 2 percent of the 1,903 competitive moves to assess the validity of the published citations observed for the sample. Fifty-eight percent of the subsample had multi- ple sources. In each and every case in the subsample, agreement between multiple sources was 100%. The measure of firm-level competitive activity was expressed quantitatively as the annual sum of each firm's moves, an approach that captures the series of competitive activities typically found in a hypercompet- itive environment (see Figure 2). The industry-level measure of competitor activity (industry-rivalry) was expressed as the aggregation of firm moves to the industry level minus the focal firm's own competitive activity. Our approach was consistent with that of 248 ORGANIZATION SCIENCE/VOl. 7, No. 3, May-June 1996 This content downloaded from              146.75.174.29 on Fri, 08 Aug 2025 15:27:50 UTC              All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms GREG YOUNG, KEN G.

Firm- and Industry-level Horizontal Cooperative Mechanisms Horizontal cooperative mechanisms are business moves undertaken jointly by competitors. We included only cooperative moves that create mechanisms for inter- firm communication but are not directly tied to a competitive activity. Building on previous work, we defined horizontal cooperative mechanisms to be eq- uity arrangements, mergers, technology licenses, and participation in trade associations and technology con- sortia (Bresser 1988, Dollinger 1990, Harrigan 1985, Koh and Venkatraman 1991). Each Predicasts F&S Index citation of such a move in the software industry was counted as one cooperative mechanism for each of the participating firms in the sample. Thus, the mea- sure captured the influence of cooperation for each participating firm without any definitional overlap with competitive activity. The industry-level measure of co- operative mechanisms was expressed as the aggrega- tion of firm-level cooperative mechanisms to the indus- try level minus the focal firm's own cooperative activity. Firm Performance We used two commonly accepted financial measures of firm performance, return on sales and return on assets. The data were collected from annual SEC filings as reported by the Disclosure database. Because the legal requirements associated with SEC filings mandate ac- curate reporting that fairly reflects business conditions, that data source is highly reliable. Control Variables Following prior research, we controlled for the size and age of the firm, which may influence the firm's flexibility of action (Aldrich and Auster 1986; Baker and Cullen 1993; Buzzell, Gale and Sultan 1975; Buzzell and Wiersema 1981; Cool et al. 1989; Fombrun and Ginzberg 1990; Nelson and Winter 1982: 310; Smith et al. 1989). The size of the firm was measured by the dollar sales of the firm, as reported in the Disclosure database of SEC filings. That measure is transformed with a log function. The age of the firm was measured in years since original corporate founding, as reported in Standard Corporate Descriptions (S & P 1992) and the Corporate Technology Directory (Corptech 1991). In addition, we controlled for industry rivalry when examining the influence of industry cooperative mecha- nisms on firm-level competitive activity. When examin- ing the influence of industry rivalry and firm-level competitive activity on performance, we controlled for industry- and firm-level cooperative mechanisms. Correlated error terms are common in studies with longitudinal data (Kennedy 1985, Smith et al. 1991). Following Fombrun and Ginzberg (1990), we corrected serial correlation by including as a separate indepen- dent variable the dependent variable lagged one pe- riod. Table 1 displays correlations for all major vari- ables. Tests and Data Analysis We tested hypotheses by applying multiple regression analysis, a typical approach to estimating economic models of firm conduct (Scherer and Ross 1990: 413). Independent measures were lagged one time period behind dependent measures to account for causal rela- tionships implied by the hypotheses. The dependent variable for Hi and H2 was the number of competitive actions of the focal firm in a year of observation, a continuous measure of firm competitive activity. The entire model was lagged one year to examine directly the causal linkage hypothe- sized between firm activity and performance. The fol- lowing hypothesized research model for Hi and H2 was specified for regression analysis.

H3 addresses the influence of competitor rivalry on firm performance, and H4 examines the influence of the firm's competitive activity on its performance. We tested those hypotheses with a second model similar to that specified in equation 1. Both competitive firm actions and competitor rivalry were specified as the independent variables of interest, and firm perfor- mance (measured by return on assets and return and sales) was the dependent variable of interest. Firm- and industry-level cooperative mechanisms were in- cluded as controls.

Hi is not supported. That is, cooper- ative mechanisms at the industry level are unrelated to a firm's competitive activity. In contrast, H2 is sup- ported. As the cooperative mechanisms in which the firm participates increase, competitive firm activity in- creases (beta = .08, p < .05). H3 and H4 Table 2 also reports the regression results for the models that examine the influence of competitor ri- valry (H3) and competitive activity (H4) on firm perfor- mance. In those models, firm competitive activity and industry competitor rivalry were entered as the princi- pal independent variables of interest. Return on assets was the dependent measure of firm performance in the first model and return on sales was used in the second. As argued in H3 the competitor rivalry measure is significant and negative (beta = -.22, p < .05 for ROA, beta = -.21, p < .05 for ROS). H4 also is sup- ported, as the influence of firm competitive activity on relative firm performance is positive and significant (beta = .22, p < .01 for ROA; beta = .22, p < .01 for ROS).

Discussion The purpose of our study was to test hypotheses about competitive firm activity that were derived from the Austrian school of economics and industrial organiza- tion economics. We developed a model of competitive activity to examine the influence of industry- and firm- level cooperative mechanisms on firm-level competitive activity, and the link between industry- and firm-level competitive activity and firm performance. Impor- tantly, we found evidence that engaging in firm-level cooperative mechanisms has a positive effect on the firm's competitive activity and that competitive firm activity is related positively to firm performance. Three of our four hypotheses are supported. Our results show that firm performance increases as competitive firm activity increases, but declines as the intensity of competitor rivalry in the industry increases (see Table 2). An examination of the coefficients, how- ever, shows that unless competitor rivalry provoked by a move is extreme the positive effects of the competi- tive move will outweigh the possible negative conse- quence of competitor rivalry.2 The relative importance of the competitive activity coefficient versus the com- petitor rivalry coefficient (an industry measure ad- justed for the focal firm) highlights the significance of firm action for performance. In particular, it suggests that firm action, for which managers have significant control, can be vital to achieving superior performance even in the face of competitive rivalry. Recent strategy literature (e.g., D'Aveni 1994, Schomburg et al. 1994, Smith et al. 1992) has encour- aged managers and scholars to consider competitor rivalry in terms of the intensity of competitive action and counteraction. Consistent with IO literature, our study empirically demonstrates the negative relation- ship between industry rivalry and firm performance. Thus, the dynamic action model provides an approach for examining the sources of firm performance in the presence of competitor rivalry. The model could be extended to examine more comprehensively the determinants of firm competitive activity and industry-level rivalry, as well as to include a link between the amount of firm activity and the level of competitor rivalry. More specifically, firms are not independent in the marketplace; they are affected by each other's actions and are prone to react (Porter 1980, Smith et al. 1992). In addition to the positive effect of competitive activity (observed in the test of H4), there could be a negative aspect if competitive activity leads to increased competitor rivalry. We are encouraged by the results of our study, but recognize the resource-based argument that sustain- able superior performance is associated with moves dominated by the use of imperfectly mobile resources (Barney 1991, Peteraf 1993). Also, the Austrian school has argued that the rate of firm activity depends on variations across firms in luck and the distribution of skills (Kirzner 1979: 135, 154). For example, the ability to anticipate and exploit profit opportunities, a core concept of the Austrian school, is a valuable resource that may be relatively immobile.

SMITH AND CURTIS M. GRIMM "Austrian" and Industrial Organization Perspectives between intangible resources and sustainable competi- tive advantage to examine imperfectly mobile resources as they relate to competitive activity. The amount of explained variance in our study suggests that unspeci- fied, perhaps intangible, variables influence firm activ- ity. We examined the dynamic model of competitive activity within the context of the software industry. Future research should explore the generalizability of the model to other environmental contexts. For exam- ple, the role of cooperative mechanisms in fast-paced and complex high-tech industries may be different from that in more stable and simpler low-tech industries. Further, Smith and Grimm (1987) found a significant relationship between types of strategy and perfor- mance outcomes after, but not before, deregulation in the railroad industry, suggesting that firm action influ- ences performance more when regulatory constraints are removed. The relationship between firm activity and perfor- mance outcomes may also be linked to the number of markets in which firms face each other in competition. For example, software firms may compete in more than one market as the software industry becomes more segmented by customer group and computer platform. Multimarket competition makes the cooperative and competitive interconnections between firms more com- plex, and competitive activity may be less attractive if rivals have multiple loci for retaliation (Gimeno and Woo 1996). The dynamic model of competitive activity proposed here could be extended to consider the ef- fects of multimarket competition. Future research also could usefully consider the as- sociation between industry structure, firm resources, and firm performance in the context of the individual firm's portfolio of competitive move types and sequenc- ing. For example, some set or sequence of competitive activity may yield more performance benefits or evoke more rivalrous countermoves. Conclusion We draw on the Austrian school of economics and the structure-conduct-performance paradigm of industrial organization to add insight to our understanding of the antecedents and consequences of firm-level competi- tive activity. Our study results indicate that the compet- itively active firm is likely to participate in cooperative activities. Importantly, we find that competitively active firms outperform less active firms. We submit that the dynamic model of competitive activity provides a framework that is grounded in theory, empirically sup- ported, and particularly suited to the examination of how competitors act in the marketplace to build their own advantage. Endnotes Prior to 1987, such firms were identified by a single four digit SIC segment, computer programming (7372). After 1987, the computer programming industry was divided into three SIC codes: computer programming services (SIC 7371), prepackaged software (SIC 7372), and computer integrated system design (SIC 7373). Firms in the original (pre-1987) SIC 7372 later appeared in any of the three new classifications. 2For example, the coefficients when firm performance is measured by return on sales indicate that a unit change in the competitive activity variable has a .222 effect on the dependent variable, whereas a unit change in the competitor rivalry variable has a - .209 effect on the dependent variable. However, in interpreting the relative magni- tude of the coefficients, it is important to recall that standardized betas are reported. The standard deviation of the firm activity variable is 12.19, whereas the standard deviation of the competitor rivalry variable is 99.69. Thus, the positive effect of an individual move is more than eight times the negative effect of a theoretical single rival competitive move, which might be in response to the firm's move.
