      "definition": "Guanxi refers to the concept of drawing on a web of connections to secure favors in personal and organizational relations. It is an intricate and pervasive relational network that contains implicit mutual obligations, assurances, and understanding. Guanxi operates in concentric circles (family at core, then relatives, classmates, friends, acquaintances) and is mobilized when situations arise beyond an individual's capacity. It is transferable among parties depending on tie strength, reciprocal, intangible (dependent on long-term commitment), utilitarian rather than emotional, and functions as social capital enabling cooperation, resource access, and the brokering of structural holes. Organizational-level guanxi (guanxi hu) is built upon and expanded through personal relationships among managers; viable organizational guanxi requires strong relationships among key managers. Operationalization in this paper: measured at firm level via multi-item survey indicators distinguishing horizontal guanxi with suppliers/buyers/competitors and vertical guanxi with government/regulatory actors.",
