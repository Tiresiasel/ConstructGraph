# ROLE AND GOAL
You are an extremely meticulous, detail-oriented research analyst and knowledge engineer. Your sole task is to act as an information extraction engine, strictly following the provided JSON Schema to convert unstructured text from the provided academic paper into structured knowledge.

## CORE DIRECTIVES

1. **Fidelity to Source** - All information you extract must originate directly from the provided paper text. You are strictly forbidden from making inferences, guessing, or adding external knowledge. If information is not present, use `null` or an empty array `[]`
2. **Schema is Supreme** - Your output must be, and can only be, a single, valid JSON object that strictly conforms to the provided JSON Schema. Do not add any explanations, comments, or Markdown formatting outside the JSON object
3. **Comprehensive Coverage** - You must make your best effort to comprehensively scan the entire paper (from abstract to references) to ensure all required information is extracted without omission
4. **Titles and Journal Names** - For `paper_metadata.title`, extract the title verbatim exactly as it appears in the paper (preserve any prefixes/suffixes, punctuation, diacritics, and casing; do not drop or normalize anything). For `paper_metadata.journal`, extract the full official journal name exactly as shown in the paper (no abbreviations or variants; preserve punctuation and casing).
5. **DOI Formatting** - For `paper_metadata.doi`, if the DOI appears as a URL (e.g., `https://doi.org/10.1000/xyz123`), return everything after the URL scheme (remove `http://` or `https://`), e.g., `doi.org/10.1000/xyz123`. If a bare DOI string is present (e.g., `10.1000/xyz123`), return it as-is.

## MULTI-STEP CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT PROCESS

Execute the following tasks in strict sequence to ensure the completeness and accuracy of the extraction:

## SCOPE POLICY (Layered: Core + Secondary)

- Core scope (mandatory): ONLY extract constructs, relationships, and measurements that are explicitly tied to Hypotheses/Propositions or appear in clearly labeled "Hypothesis Development"/"Proposition" sections. Each extracted item MUST include an anchoring field to identify the hypothesis/proposition (see schema additions below).
- Secondary scope (allowed, minimal):
  - Measurements for the core constructs, even if described in Methods/Measures section, as long as they can be explicitly mapped back to a core construct.
  - Results that explicitly confirm or refute a specific hypothesis/proposition (Empirical_Result) and can be linked to its identifier.
- Out of scope: Exploratory/ancillary relationships, general literature review claims, or findings that are not clearly tied to a numbered/named hypothesis/proposition or its direct development.

### Phase 1: Initial Scan & Global Classification

1. Read the entire paper to understand its overall structure and purpose.
2. Extract the top-level metadata to populate the `paper_metadata` section.
3. **Crucially, classify the `research_type`** based on its methodology. Is it `Quantitative`, `Qualitative`, `Conceptual`, `Review`, `Meta-Analysis`, or `Mixed-Methods`?
4. **Identify Replication Study**: Determine if the paper is explicitly a `Replication Study` and set the `is_replication_study` boolean accordingly.

### Phase 2: Relationship-First Identification and Construct Harvesting (Core-only)

This is the most critical phase. Your primary goal is to find all relationship claims first, as this guarantees the capture of all relevant constructs.

1. **Systematic Search for Claims**: Meticulously scan the paper, focusing on the **Hypotheses, Hypothesis Development, Propositions, and Results sections**. Identify ONLY claims that belong to a Hypothesis or Proposition (including their development) or that explicitly confirm/refute them in Results.
2. **Harvest Constructs from Claims**: For **every single relationship claim** you identify, immediately extract all the construct `term`s mentioned within that claim (e.g., the subject, object, moderators, mediators).

   **CRITICAL RULE FOR CONSTRUCT NAMES:**
   - Extract ONLY the FULL construct name, NOT abbreviations in parentheses
   - **Examples of CORRECT extraction:**
     - ✅ "organizational commitment" (NOT "organizational commitment (OC)")
     - ✅ "network constraint" (NOT "network constraint (NC)")
     - ✅ "structural holes" (NOT "structural holes (SH)")
   - **Examples of INCORRECT extraction:**
     - ❌ "organizational commitment (OC)"
     - ❌ "network constraint (NC)"
     - ❌ "structural holes (SH)"
   - **Rule**: Remove ALL parenthetical abbreviations and keep only the complete construct name
   - **Global Application**: Apply the same rule to ALL terms (constructs, moderators, mediators, controls) AND to measurement names. Examples:
     - ✅ "distance" (NOT "distance (d)")
     - ✅ "return on assets" (NOT "return on assets (ROA)")
     - ✅ "research and development intensity" (NOT "R&D intensity")

   **CRITICAL RULE FOR DETAILED EXTRACTION:**
   - **Definitions must be comprehensive**: Extract the FULL definition, not just a brief mention
   - **Context must be rich**: Include enough context so someone unfamiliar with the paper can understand the concept
   - **Examples**: If the paper provides examples, include them in the definition
   - **Operational details**: Include how the construct is operationalized or measured
   - **Boundary conditions**: Extract any limitations or conditions mentioned for the construct
   - **Measurements must be detailed**: Include complete measurement procedures, scales, formulas, and validation details

   **CRITICAL RULE FOR CONSTRUCT SELECTION:**
   - **ONLY extract theoretical constructs** that appear in propositions, hypotheses, or theoretical frameworks
   - **Include related measurements** ONLY for those constructs mentioned in hypotheses/propositions
   - **Include control variables** ONLY when they have clear theoretical justification and are explicitly tied to the hypotheses/propositions
   - **Examples of what NOT to extract**: "p-value", "sample size", standalone mathematical parameters not framed as constructs
   - **Examples of what TO extract**: "modularity", "network constraint", "structural holes", "organizational commitment"
3. **Compile a Master List (Core Anchored)**: Create a master list of all construct `term`s harvested from the core claims only. For each item, capture the hypothesis/proposition identifier when available (e.g., `H1`, `H1a`, `P2`).

### Phase 3: Construct De-duplication, Dimension Identification & Definition Search

1. **De-duplicate**: Create a unique set of construct `term`s from the master list compiled in Phase 2.
2. **Identify Dimensions**: Re-examine the paper, especially the literature review and theory sections. If the paper describes a construct (e.g., "Organizational Justice") as being composed of multiple dimensions (e.g., "Distributive Justice," "Procedural Justice"), you must capture these hierarchical links and populate the `construct_dimensions` array.
3. **Targeted Definition Search**: For **each unique term**, now go back through the paper and search for its most explicit, verbatim `definition` and `context_snippet`.

   **CRITICAL - Detailed Definition Extraction:**
   - **Definitions must be comprehensive**: Extract the FULL definition, not just a brief mention
   - **Context must be rich**: Include enough context so someone unfamiliar with the paper can understand the concept
   - **Examples**: If the paper provides examples, include them in the definition
   - **Mathematical notation**: If the construct involves mathematical formulas or parameters, extract them completely
   - **Operational details**: Include how the construct is operationalized or measured
   - **Boundary conditions**: Extract any limitations or conditions mentioned for the construct
4. **Populate Constructs Array**: Populate the `constructs` array in the final JSON with every unique term and its found definition. If a term involved in a relationship has no explicit definition, it **must** still be included in this array (its `definition` field can be `null`).

### Phase 4: In-depth, Methodology-Aware Relationship Characterization

Now, return to the relationship claims identified in Phase 2 and characterize them in detail.

1. **Identify General Properties**:
   - Clearly identify the `subject_term` and `object_term`.
   - Determine the `status`: is it a `Hypothesized` claim or an `Empirical_Result`?
   - Find any `supporting_theories`, `moderators`, and `mediators`.
   - **Extract Boundary Conditions**: Extract any `boundary_conditions` the authors set for the hypothesis or finding (e.g., "only in high-tech industries").
   - **Extract Replication Outcome**: If the paper is a replication study, determine and extract the `replication_outcome` for key relationships (`Successful`, `Failed`, or `Mixed`).

2. **Branch Extraction by Evidence Type**:
   - **If the evidence is Quantitative**:
     - Set `evidence_type` to `Quantitative`.
     - Extract `effect_direction`, `non_linear_type`, `is_meta_analysis`, `is_validated_causality`.
     - Additionally, populate `causal_support_level`, `design_type`, `manipulated_variable`, and optional `causal_notes` for each specific subject→object relationship.
     - Leave qualitative fields as `null`.
   - **If the evidence is Qualitative**:
     - Set `evidence_type` to `Qualitative`.
     - Extract the `qualitative_finding` and `supporting_quote`.
     - Leave all quantitative fields as `null`.

   **STRICT RULES for Moderators and Non-linear Effects**:
   - Moderators: Only extract a variable as a moderator when the paper explicitly labels it as a moderator or clearly claims a moderating effect (e.g., "X moderates the relationship between A and B", "we test moderation by X"). Do not infer moderators from generic interaction terms unless explicitly described as moderation by the authors.
   - Non-linear Effects: Only set `effect_direction` to a non-linear category or `non_linear_type` when the paper explicitly states a form (e.g., "U-shaped", "inverted U-shaped", "S-shaped", "curvilinear with U-shape"). The mere presence of polynomial terms or curvature tests without explicit labeling must NOT be treated as non-linear.

### Phase 5: Measurement Extraction (Secondary allowed to support Core)

For constructs that are operationalized in the methodology section, extract their specific `measurement` methods ONLY if they map directly to a core-scoped construct (from Phases 2–4). Ensure explicit mapping from measurement to the construct and, when applicable, to the linked hypothesis/proposition identifier.

**CRITICAL - Comprehensive Measurement Extraction:**
- **Extract complete measurement procedures**: Include step-by-step operationalization details
- **Include measurement scales**: Extract the specific scales, questionnaires, or instruments used
- **Mathematical formulas**: If measurements involve formulas or calculations, extract them completely
- **Validation details**: Include reliability, validity, and other psychometric properties mentioned
- **Examples of items**: If the paper provides sample questionnaire items, include them
- **Scoring procedures**: Explain how responses are converted to construct scores
- **Context-specific details**: Include any industry-specific or context-specific measurement adaptations

## Theory Extraction (Core-only)

Goal:
Extract only the theories that explicitly ground the paper’s core claims. Exclude background/literature-survey theories that are not used to justify the core arguments.

Inclusion (must satisfy ALL):
- The theory is explicitly used to justify a core claim.
- The claim is anchored to one of the following (ordered by strength):
  1) Hypothesis / Proposition with identifier (e.g., H1, H1a, P2)
  2) Formal label: Theorem / Proposition / Lemma / Corollary (e.g., T1, P1, L1, C1)
  3) Model Result (e.g., “Result 1”, “We show that…”, “The model predicts that…”)
  4) Core Claim sentence (e.g., “we propose/argue/show/predict that…”, “it follows that…”, “implies that…”)
- Provide at least one textual anchor: section_header and/or a short context_snippet containing the grounding phrase (e.g., “drawing on”, “based on”, “grounded in”).
- Do NOT include theories mentioned only as prior work without being used to justify a core claim.

Strict rules:
- Name hygiene: output the full theory name only; drop parenthetical abbreviations (e.g., use “resource-based view”, not “RBV (resource-based view)”).
- Origin source: set origin_source to one of Hypothesis | Proposition | Hypothesis_Development | Results-Confirming | Theorem | Proposition_Label | Model_Result | Core_Claim
- Claims linkage: 
  - If H/P is available, set hypothesis_id (e.g., H1, H1a, P2).
  - Always set claim_id (stable id) for the core claim (e.g., H1/H1a/P2/T1/Result1/CC1). If no author label exists, generate CC1/CC2… in reading order.

The final output MUST be a single, valid JSON object that strictly conforms to the following JSON Schema.

We propose that the size, interconnectedness and diversity of competition networksinfluencesubsequentproductmarketentryinasystemicway.Wetestourhypothesesin auniquedatasetdrawnfromtheaircraftmodificationindustry. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. INTRODUCTION We theorize that the rate at which firms enter new product markets is influenced by the structure of each firm’s competition network. Competition networks are defined as the relational structures of interdependence between rivals that emerge from direct competition. The idea of competition networks is important because it has the potential tofacilitatethedevelopmentofmoreencompassing theories of interorganizational networks and to expand our understanding of product market entry specifically and competitive dynamics generally. The idea that social networks can be based on ties of competitive interdependence makes this study different from social network research based on cooperative relationships (Burt, 1992, 2007; Keywords: networktheory;competition;multimarketcon- tact; clustering; aircraft; competitive dynamics *Correspondenceto:PaulF.Skilton,WashingtonStateUniversity, Tri-Cities, 2710 Crimson Drive, Richland WA 99354, U.S.A. E-mail: Paul.Skilton@wsu.edu Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Carpenter, Li, and Jiang, 2012; Provan, Fish, and Sydow, 2007). To develop this idea we build on a core proposition of competitive dynamics theory that competition creates interdependencies expressed through patterns of action and response (BarnettandPontikes,2008;BaumandKorn,1999; Chen, 1996; Gimeno and Woo, 1996; Smithetal., 1991; Tsai, Su, and Chen, 2011). Our goal is to build on the strong foundation provided by stud- ies of dyadic and triadic relations between firms and their competitors (Gimeno, 2004; Madhavan, Gnyawali, and He, 2004) by using social network theory to examine whole networks of competition. AlthoughYao,Ferrier,andYu’s,2007studywasthe first we are aware of to investigate whole networks of competition, it is limited by its reliance on ideas based on cooperation. We shift the level of analysis to competition network structure because we think the overall structure of competitive relationships should play a critical role in product market entry. Combin- ing competitive dynamics theory (Baum and Korn, 1999; Chen, 1996; Gimeno, 2004; Smith etal., 1991) and social network theory (Borgatti and CompetitionNetworkStructureandProductMarketEntry 1689 Lopez-Kidwell,2011;Burt,1992;KnokeandYang, 2008; Simmel, 1964) leads to new questions that can help us understand product market entry, such as: How do the size and interconnectedness of a firm’s competition network influence its product market entry? How does diversity in a firm’s net- work of competitors influence its product market entry behavior? We test our theory with data from the market for modifications of aircraft in the United States, using datafromtheFederalAviationAdministration.The industry that serves this market is diverse, widely distributed, and devoid of cooperation between competitors. It thus has few of the characteristics that would encourage a conventional network anal- ysis. We nonetheless find that several competition network structure constructs are related to product market entry. THEORY DEVELOPMENT We study product market entry because it is an important element of competition and because it can change the structure of competition networks. Entering new markets changes the mix of competi- torsafirmfacesbyincreasingordecreasingcontact with old rivals and by creating contact with new rivals. Product market entry thus alters the need for competitive action. This sets it apart from compet- itive moves such as advertising or price changes, which do not usually change which firms com- pete with each other. There is wide agreement that competition is an important motive for product market entry (Baum and Korn, 1999; Hage, 1999; Mitchell,1989;Yao etal.,2007).Whilestudieslike these demonstrate other reasons for product market entry(tosellneworexistingproducts,deployslack resources, or exploit learned capabilities for entry), wefocusnarrowlyonhowthestructureofcompeti- tion networks influences product market entry. Our theorizing is thus concerned primarily with prod- uct market entry that occurs as firms try to escape from, preempt, imitate, or respond to competitors. Wecontrolforothercausesofproductmarketentry without integrating them into our hypotheses. Competition networks emerge from the interac- tion of social entities (Simmel, 1964). Competi- tive relationships exhibit the essential attributes of relational form that make network theory viable (KnokeandYang,2008)becausetheyareexpressed over time in sequences that vary in intensity, frequency, and strength. The important difference between cooperation and competition networks is that, while in cooperation networks action follows private information flows, in competition networks action follows from selective attention to public actions (Gimeno, 2004; Smith etal., 1991; Tsai etal.,2011).Followingalongtraditionincompeti- tiontheory,weassumethatfirmspaymoreattention to direct competitors (Barnett and Pontikes, 2008; Baum and Korn, 1999; Chen, 1996; Gimeno, 2004; Mitchell, 1989; Smithetal., 1991). Borgatti and Lopez-Kidwell (2011) distinguish between network flow models and network archi- tecture models. Most social network research involves flow models in which private information is transmitted through cooperative ties. Examples are Granovetter’s strength of weak ties theory (1973) or small world theory (Guimerà etal., 2005). In contrast, a network architecture model is one in which effects propagate across connections withoutstrictlyflowing.InanarchitectureModelA acts, which leads B to act differently, so that C acts differently,andsoon.Signalsaretransmittedbutdo not necessarily stay the same as they are received and acted on. Davis’s theory of organizational adaptation (1991) and Burt’s theory of brokerage (1992, 2007) are examples of network architecture model research. This study differs from prior attempts to com- bine competitive dynamics and social network theory (Yaoetal., 2007) by proposing that compe- tition networks belong to the network architecture Figure 1.

In Figure 1 firm A competes with firms B and C, who do not compete with each other. If A reacts to a move by B, C might respond to A’s action or do nothing. Similarly, if A fails to react to a move by B, C is not prevented from respond- ing to the lack of action. This suggests that in a competition network signals originating from indi- rect connections (B is connected to C indirectly through A while A and C compete directly) are transformedbyhowmediatingcompetitorsrespond to them. My enemy’s enemy might be my friend (Gimeno,2004),butwhatmatterstomeiswhatmy enemydoes.ThisresonateswithBurt’s(2007)find- ingthatdirectconnectionsareeffectivelythesource ofstimuliforthefocalfirm,ratherthanbrokerswho control information flows from distant parts of the network. Because of this we focus on the structure of the ego network rather than position in the total network. If we exclude B, Figure 1 depicts C’s ego network of direct competitors. Our basic proposition is that the structure of an ego network at a given time will influence a firm’s later product market entry behavior. By structurewemeanthesize,interconnectedness,and diversityoftheegonetwork.Whilerecognizingthat other factors influence product market entry (Hage, 1999; Mitchell, 1989) we focus on the effects of competition networks structure. Large networks provide more stimuli for prod- uct market entry. Other things being equal, a larger network should expose the firm to more opportuni- ties to enter markets and motivations for doing so. Firms with large networks will be better positioned toobservemoreproductinnovationsoridentifynew customers and competitors. Product market entry should become more common as the firm enters contestedmarketsinsearchofparitywithnumerous rivalsoruncontestedmarketstogetawayfromcom- petitors.Althoughlimitsonafirm’sslackresources or saturation of available markets could cause the relationshipbetweennetworksizeandproductmar- ket entry to be nonlinear, for this study we propose a simple linear relationship. Hypothesis 1: The rate of product market entry willincreaseasegonetworksizeincreases. As Burt has long argued (1992, 2007) the interconnectedness of networks influences the performance of the firms in them. Densely con- nected networks should have different effects on patterns of competition than sparsely connected ones. When a firm’s competitors also compete with each other, their actions will be interdependent. The more densely connected a network is the more interdependent action should be. Burt (1992, 2007) theorizes that dense ties in a network mean that its members act in similar ways, reducing the variety of actions the focal actor is exposed to. In densely connected networks, entering a single product market may be useful for responding to several rivals. If this is the case, firms can lower the cost of competing by taking fewer actions, which suggests that network density should lead to lower levels of competition driven product market entry. Reduced levelsofproductmarketentryindenselyconnected networks are also more likely because any entry activity could provoke multiple responses. If entering a new product market causes ripple effects of subsequent competitive activity and thus makes competition more costly overall, firms with dense competition networks may be more selective in their product market entry choices. Since product market entry is costly and responses to it may propagate rapidly through a densely connected network, we would expect firms to respond to density by entering fewer markets, ceteris paribus. Hypothesis 2: The rate of product market entry willdecreaseasegonetworkdensityincreases. The diversity of competitors in a firm’s ego net- work should influence product market entry in a similar way. Our argument concerning density is that interdependence reduces the variety of actions a firm responds to. A related argument is that when rivals are similar on meaningful attributes they should behave in similar ways, even if they are not interdependent. A network of diverse com- petitors should have different effects on product market entry than a network of similar competitors (Baum and Korn, 1999; Mitchell, 1989; Tsaietal., 2011).Whenafirm’srivalsaresimilar,fewerprod- uctmarketentriesmaybenecessarytoremaincom- petitive. Spender’s (1989) description of the emer- gence of industry recipes for action is an example of how competitors develop similar resource bases and competitive routines. When a firm’s rivals are diverse,itmayneedtoentermoremarketstomain- tain parity, achieve advantage (Li and Greenwood, 2004), or escape or preempt competition. This sug- gests that product market entry will be more fre- quentwhenafirm’segonetworkisdiverse.Aswith network size, although the relationship between Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Hypothesis 3: The rate of product market entry willincreaseascompetitordiversityincreases. METHODS The research setting for this study is the aircraft modification industry in the United States. One of the reasons we chose to study this industry is that we could find little evidence that firms competing in it cooperate, making this a setting where a conventional network study would not be possible. Although embeddedness in collaborative networks (Afuah, 2013; Hage, 1999; Madhavanetal., 2004; Whittington, Owen-Smith, and Powell, 2009) is an important driver of innovation and subsequent market entry, our primary purpose in this study is to show that network theory can be applied equally well to competitive relationships. Aircraft modifications are an aftermarket in which aircraft owners buy services that replace or modify original equipment. Competitors include small firms whose sole business is the installation of third-party equipment, aftermarket equipment makers who install their own products, fixed-base operators who maintain and modify aircraft, major systems sellers who retrofit aircraft to support original equipment sales, airline maintenance oper- ations that upgrade their own and others’ fleets, and airframe manufacturers who offer aftermarket modification services. Some modifiers focus on specific types of aircraft (helicopters or jets) or modifications (galley reconfiguration or radio replacement), while others are broad generalists. Aircraft are registered with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on the basis of type certifi- cate data sheets (TCDS). TCDS often cover multi- plemodelsofasingleaircrafttype.Typecertificate data sheets are frequently amended and renewed. For example, TCDS A16WE covers 12 models of the Boeing 737 and was updated 21 times between 1998 and 2011. Modifications of aircraft registered in the United StatesmustalsobeapprovedbytheFAA.Approved modifications are formalized in supplemental type certificates (STCs). In order to offer a new product or extend existing products to new aircraft types a firm must apply for a new STC. Since each STC is issued to a single firm and specifies modifications not covered by its prior STCs, every STC repre- sents an act of product market entry. Because an STC may apply to several aircraft types, it may represent simultaneous entry into several markets. An example is STC SA1514SW which allowed Rockwell Collins to modify radio systems in Boe- ing 737 aircraft covered by TCDS A16WE. This data makes it possible to identify product market entry and competitors who perform the same modifications on the same aircraft types and hence for the same set of customers. Rockwell Collins and Honeywell both have STCs for modifying radio systems in 737 to 400seconds, making them direct competitors in that product market. Data The primary sources for this study are the FAA databases of supplemental type certificates (FAA, 2011a) and type certificate data sheets (FAA, 2011b). We limit data to modifiers who were granted STCs later than 1989, since this provides us with ample data without requiring us to account for variation in the regulatory environment. In the 1990s, 1,934 entities had at least one STC issued to them. Among U.S. aircraft modifiers, the average was 6.8 STCs issued in the 1990s and 6.5 in the 2000s. Ninety-fourpercent of firm-years in the period have no new STCs. Since there is no reason to assume that the year is a natural unit for product market entry, we test our hypotheses by relating independent variables based on activity in the decade 1990–1999 to product market entry between 2000 and 2009. Using decade-long win- dows allows us to create reliable variables from infrequent events. We made a systematic effort to determine whether firms were going concerns for all or part of the 2000s. If firms (1) created or modified STCs during the 2000s; (2) were listed as an active corporation in a state register in the 2000s; (3) had a business telephone listing in the 2000s; or (4) couldbeidentifiedaspurchased,merged,orhaving changedtheirnamesduringthe2000s,weincluded them as going concerns. We gathered this data usinginternetsearchesperformedduring2013,and eliminated 215 entities as a result. Identification as a going concern does not mean a firm is an active competitor.

We therefore chose oursamplebyidentifyinggoingconcernsthatwere issued at least three STCs in the decade beginning in 1990 for fixed wing or rotary wing aircraft. Of thegoingconcerns,671metthistest.Thefour-firm concentration ratio for STCs among these firms for the two-decade period is 13.8percent. Measures Wemeasuredthedependentvariable,futureproduct market entry, as the count of new STCs issued to each firm between 2000 and 2009. We measured direct competition by identifying STCs that apply similar modifications to the same aircraftmodel/types.Weidentifiedmodificationson the basis of descriptive noun pairs. Examples of noun pairs are “collision avoidance” or “fuel tank.” Our process was to use a text analysis package to identify the nouns in the text descriptions of STCs. Aftereliminatingpropernames,numbers,andiden- tification codes, aggregating plurals and variants, andeliminatingnondescriptivenounslike“system” or “installation,” we limited the list to nouns that occurred in more than 50 STCs. This gave us a listof227frequentlyoccurringmeaningfuldescrip- tive nouns that appeared in more than 80percent of STCs issued after 1990. Since nouns in iso- lation are difficult to interpret, we then identified co-occurrences of noun pairs across STCs.

Of 671firmsinthesample,611hadoneormoredirect competitors in the 1990s who we considered to be going concerns in the 2000s. Degree is the network theory name for ego net- work size. Degree as of 2000 was calculated as the count of direct competitor going concerns, as defined above. Density is measured as the percent- age of possible competitive ties between members of the ego network that are actually realized. Our third hypothesis concerns the diversity of competitors, on the assumption that firms with dif- ferent attributes will compete in different ways. To examinediversityincompetitionnetworksinaway thatbuildsonpriorresearchandgivesusinsightinto theeffectsofdiversecompetitoraction,wedevelop a measure of diversity using a construct from the competitive dynamics literature, multimarket con- tact (Chen, 1996; Gimeno and Woo, 1996; Li and Greenwood,2004).Theliteraturehasdemonstrated thatwhenrivalscompeteinfewmarkets,theyoften compete aggressively, but that when rivals are in contactinmultiplemarkets,thelevelofcompetitive action between them generally declines (Baum and Korn, 1999). This is a desirable characteristic for a diversity measure in this study because it speaks directly to the variety of action a firm faces from its network of competitors. To convert multimar- ket contact from a dyad level measure to a network level measure, we calculated multimarket contact between each firm and its direct competitors and usedthesevaluestocalculateameasureofthediver- sity of the competitive relationships each firm is in. We measured multimarket contact using the method developed by Baum and Korn (1999), which weights each shared market by its centrality inafirm’sportfolioofmarkets.Wemeasurethecen- tralityofmarket minacompany i’sportfolioasthe proportion ofi’s other product markets that share a word pair or a model/type with marketm. We mea- sure multimarket contact between going concernsi andjin the decade from 1991 to 2000 as follows: ∑M i [ Cim × ( Dim×Djm )] +∑Mj [ Cjm× ( Dim×Djm )] Mi+Mj for all ∑Mi(Dim × Djm)> 1, where m denotes a given market in the set of marketsMi or Mj served by firms i and j, respectively. Cim and Cjm are the centralities of marketm to firms i and j, and Dim and Djm are indicator variables set equal to 1 if firms i or j are active in market m during the decade and 0 otherwise. The diversity of a focal firm’s multimarket contact is measured as the coefficient of variation (standard deviation divided by mean) of multimarket contact with the firm’s direct competitors. The coefficient of variation is a commonly used measure of dispersion. We also testedmeasuresbasedonthediversityofcompetitor egonetworksize,networkdensity,andpriormarket entry behavior, measured as the number of STCs issued to each competitor in the 1990s. These alternatives produced similar results. Controls We controlled for whether the firm was a TCDS holder because holders are usually airframe Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

We controlled for the kinds of aircraft the firm works on by identifying aircraft as fixed or rotary wingandasbeingsingleormultienginesincethese broad market categories imply different skills. The controls are the percentage of a firm’s STCs in the 1990s involving rotorcraft or multiengine aircraft. It is necessary to control for learned market entry capability because if firms have learned to enter product markets in the past, they are likely to continue to do so regardless of differences in net- work structure (Hage, 1999).We measured learned marketentrycapabilityasthecountofSTCsissued toeachfirminthe1990s.Thismeasureiscorrelated withafirm’sageinyearsasof2000( r= 0.29).Age inyearsisneversignificantwhenincludedasacon- trol, which is consistent with the idea that learning by doing matters more than the passage of time. RESULTS Descriptive statistics and correlations are shown in Table 1. The controls for multiengine aircraft and rotorcraft are negatively correlated, as expected. About 10percent of firms are type certificate hold- ers, which is significantly correlated with product market entry. The three independent variables are moderately correlated with each other. To analyze our model we used a negative binomial regression (Whittington etal., 2009). This method is appropriate because a Pearson goodness-of-fittestindicatesthatthedistributionof the dependent variable is overdispersed. A Poisson regression would underestimate standard errors and generate misleading results. To guard against inferential overreaching, we interpret as significant only results that are robust across models. Table 2 presents the results of the negative bino- mial regression models. Model 1 presents the con- trolvariables,Models2–4presentthehypothesized effects separately and Model 5 presents the fully specified model. In Model 1 the coefficients for learned market entry capability and type certificate holdervariablesarepositiveandsignificantlydiffer- entfromzero.ExperiencedfirmsandTCDSholders enter more markets over time. The coefficients for the percentage of rotorcraft and multiengine markets are not significantly different from zero. In Model 2 of Table 2, ego network size is entered. Hypothesis 1 is supported. As the number of competitors in ego networks increases, the rate of product market entry increases. In Model 3 the variable for ego network density is entered into the control model. Its coefficient is not significantly different from zero, so that Hypothesis 2 is not supported. In Model 4 the diversity of multimarket contact variable is entered into the control model. The estimated coefficient is positive and significant andthussupportsHypothesis3.Model5showsthe fully specified model. The results are stable. We performed a number of post hoc tests. We tested for nonlinear effects of network size and diversity, since exhaustion of slack resources or other causes may place limits on how much prod- uct market entry is possible for any firm. Post hoc tests show that the squared term for network size is significant, indicating that the relationship between network size and product market entry has an inverted U shape. We tested for interactions between the independent variables, but no signifi- cant effects were observed. Table 1. Descriptive statistics and correlationsa Mean Std dev. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1.

DISCUSSION The aircraft modification market is not a setting where network theory would normally be applied becausethereislittlecooperationbetweenthefirms competing in it. By demonstrating that competitive interdependence can be used as the basis for whole network analysis, this study greatly expands the rangeofpossibleapplicationsofnetworktheoryand reveals new effects of the structure of competition networks on product market entry. The second major contribution of this paper is finding that the size and diversity of ego networks influence product market entry. Using our mea- sure of the diversity of multimarket contacts (and measures of diversity-based on other competitor attributes), we found support for our argument that the diversity of competitors in ego networks should have a positive relationship with the level of future product market entry. Our finding that ego network sizeinfluencescompetitivebehaviorisalignedwith results from prior studies. Developing and testing our measure of network diversity takes the field a step further toward the goal of understanding howthenetworkstructureofcompetitioninfluences competitive behavior. In contrast, our hypothesis that network den- sity would influence product market entry was not supported.Whileweproposedthatdensetieswould produce interdependent patterns of action within networks, leading to reduced product market entry, no such reduction was detected. It could be that increased slack is a secondary effect of density. If firms enter fewer markets in response to densely connected rivals, this may free resources to enter marketsforreasonsotherthandirectcompetition.A second avenue for exploration of this result would be to condition density with tie strength (Burt, 1992). Our treatment of competition as binary leaves out information about factors that could make some ties more important than others. Future scholarship has an opportunity to correct these omissions. Thecontrolforthepercentageofofferingsrelated tomultiengineaircraftissometimessignificant,but the volatility of this result leads us to reject it as a meaningful finding. The control for rotorcraft per- centage is never significant. The positive and sig- nificant TCDS holder variable result was robust. Airframe manufacturers enter more product mar- kets, and as expected, they usually modify their ownoriginalequipment.Weusedasimplemeasure of learned capability to control for an alternative explanationofproduct market entry. Itcomesasno surprise that firms that have entered many product markets in the past continue to do so (Hage, 1999; Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Strat.Mgmt.J. ,36: 1688–1696 (2015) DOI: 10.1002/smj 10970266, 2015, 11, Downloaded from https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2318 by <Shibboleth>-member@city.ac.uk, Wiley Online Library on [08/08/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License CompetitionNetworkStructureandProductMarketEntry 1695 Mitchell, 1989). It is more interesting to us that the effects of learning do not overshadow the effects of competition network structure. Posthocanalysisdetectedasignificantnonlinear effect of network size on product market entry but not for the diversity variable. When ego networks are small, entry increases at a decreasing rate. We can partly infer that this trend reflects the exhaus- tion of slack resources or decreasing opportunities for entry as markets become crowded. When ego networks are large the rate of product market entry declines as degree increases. The inflection point of the inverted U is about 2 standard deviations above the mean. Closer inspection reveals that a clusterof45firmsoccupiestheregionatandabove the inflection point. These firms fit into three cate- gories:airframemanufacturers(e.g.Learjet);major systemsmanufacturers(Honeywell),andmajorair- lines (Delta). These firms compete primarily in other arenas; modification is a support activity for their main businesses. The implication is that com- petition with “pure” modifiers matters little to their mainstrategies andthus has lessinfluence on prod- uct market entry. “Pure” modifiers are committed to the modification market and experience stronger effects on product market entry from rivalry in this industry. Future studies of competition networks will benefit from greater attention to segmentation in competition than this note was able to give. CONCLUSION This study shows that social network theory can be appliedinsettingswherecooperativetiesareabsent and, therefore, expands its range of application. This study makes a further contribution by provid- ing new insights into the relationship between net- work structure and competitive behavior. By show- ing that ego network size and the diversity of com- petitorrelationshipsinfluenceproductmarketentry, we show that behavior is influenced by the struc- tureofthewholecompetitionnetworkinadditionto dyadic or triadic rivalry (Gimeno, 2004; Madhavan etal., 2004). Because the effects of competition networks do not depend on cooperation, formalizing them has the potential to expand the range of phenomena we can study with social network methods. Many new settings and questions become available to network-oriented scholars as a result of this study. Themostobviousnewquestionsconcernmultiplex relationships: How docooperation and competition networksinteract?Dofirmswithstrongcooperative ties stay close to their original markets, or do they migrate into new markets? Do simultaneous coop- erationandcompetitionleadtomarketpartitioning? Arenetworkconceptsthatmovebeyondtheegonet- work, such as betweenness or closeness centrality, equally applicable to cooperation and competition networks? Questions that relate to change in struc- ture are also intriguing: Do changes in structure resultingfromproductmarketentrybyfirstmovers havedifferenteffectsfromchangescausedbyentry offollowers?Underwhatconditionsdocompetitors act to stay close to each other or move apart? The study responds to calls for research that addresses the question of how networks develop (Carpenter etal., 2012; Provan etal., 2007) by including learned market entry capability in the study.Controllingforlearnedbehaviorisimportant becauseitisaparsimoniousalternativeexplanation for many network phenomena. While we were able to provide only a partial test for the effect of slack resources on market entry, our results suggest that this is also a factor in how networks change. This study suffers from the usual limitations of large-scale archival studies. Because our sample is made up of diverse competitors acting over a long period of time, it was not practical to gather data on commercial performance. The study is also lim- itedbyourdecisiontoexamineaggregateoutcomes ratherthanindividualevents.Moreworkisrequired to deal with the strength of ties, the forms of rela- tionships between constructs, different classes of events, environmental change, and time-based het- erogeneity within firms and networks. Some may see endogeneity as a potential limitation of papers likeoursthatanalyzecorrelationsbetweennetwork structureandmeasuresofcompanybehaviororper- formance.

### Controlled Vocabulary and Alias Mapping (Canonicalization)

- Use canonical labels for recurring constructs/measurements; map near-synonyms to the canonical `term` and record alternatives in `aliases`.
- Examples (non-exhaustive; prefer these canonical labels):
  - presence_of_a_star (aliases: ["star_presence", "star firm"])
  - innovative_productivity (aliases: ["patent-weighted productivity"])
  - innovative_leadership_among_non_star_scientists (aliases: ["innovative leadership"])
  - breadth_of_star_expertise (aliases: ["technological breadth of star"])
  - star_collaborative_strength (aliases: ["star’s collaborative strength"])
  - product_market_entry_rate (aliases: ["rate of product market entry", "product/future product market entry"])
  - competitor_diversity (aliases: ["diversity_of_multimarket_contact"])
  - guanxi_with_business_community (dimension)
  - guanxi_with_government_authorities (dimension)
- When the paper distinguishes guanxi dimensions, extract them as separate constructs and reflect hierarchy via `construct_dimensions`.

### Minimal Coverage and Coverage Report

- Aim for minimal coverage where applicable (justify exceptions in `coverage_report.reason`):
  - Quantitative: ≥ 10 constructs; ≥ 12 relationships; ≥ 6 measurements
  - Qualitative/Conceptual: ≥ 8 constructs; ≥ 2 relationships; measurements optional
  - Simulation/ABM/Modeling: include `Model_Result`-anchored relationships and key parameters; measurements optional
- If unmet, include a root-level `coverage_report` with counts (or "none_found") and a brief `reason`. Add `errors` such as "no_anchor_found", "insufficient_evidence" when applicable.

### Anchor Priority and Normalization

- Prioritize anchoring to: Hypothesis/Proposition IDs > Theorem/Proposition_Label > Model_Result > Core_Claim.
- Titles: extract verbatim paper title; exclude series labels (e.g., "Research Notes and Commentaries").
- Journal: output full official name as shown in the paper.
- DOI: remove the URL scheme; return `doi.org/...` or bare DOI string.
