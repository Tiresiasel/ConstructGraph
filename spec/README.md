## üìù Document Maintenance

- **Technical specifications** are stable and should only be updated for major architectural changes
- **Development guides** should be updated as the codebase evolves
- **API reference** must be kept in sync with actual API implementation
- **Deployment guides** should reflect current infrastructure and procedures
- **Experimental docs** are updated as research progresses

## üîÑ Contributing to Documentation

When contributing to documentation:

1. **Update the relevant spec file** in the appropriate category
2. **Update this README** if adding new documents or changing structure
3. **Cross-reference related documents** where appropriate
4. **Test all links and examples** before submitting
5. **Follow the established naming conventions** and directory structure
