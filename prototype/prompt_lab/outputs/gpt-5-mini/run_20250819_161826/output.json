Operationalized using five scales rated by questionnaire respondents: estimated financial expense, degree of disruption of staff and systems, amount of relocation of staff or equipment required, need for complex coordination among functional departments, and overall perceived difficulty. An overall difficulty scale also assessed by the authors. The Cronbach Alpha for the 5-scale Response Difficulty measure was 0.95.",
