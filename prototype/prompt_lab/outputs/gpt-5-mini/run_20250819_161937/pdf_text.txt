We explore a novel mechanism of network change that occurs when a ﬁrm acquires another one and inherits its network ties. Such “node collapse” can radically restructure the network in one transaction, constituting a revolutionary change compared with the incremental eﬀect of tie additions and deletions, which have been the focus of prior research. We explore several properties of node collapses: their eﬃcacy in helping ﬁrms achieve superior network positions, the externalities they impose on other network actors, and how they provide exclusive control over both internal and network resources. Using a simulation in which actors compete to acquire one another, we model network dynamics driven by node collapses. We ﬁnd that node collapses directly aﬀect the perfor- manceoftheacquirerandindirectlythatofotheractors,andthatthedirectionofnetwork evolution hinges on the degree to which ﬁrms pursue internal versus network synergies through node collapses.

Keywords: networks• node collapse• mergers and acquisitions• competitive dynamics• simulations and agent-based modeling Introduction Interorganizational networks function as “pipes” through which ﬁrms obtain valuable resources (Gulati 1999,Podolny2001,ZaheerandBell2005).Theposition aﬁrmoccupiesinanetworkcanbevaluablebecauseof how it facilitates access to those resources. Hence, the question of how ﬁrms obtain superior network posi- tions is important (e.g., Ahuja et al. 2012, Hallen and Eisenhardt 2012, Ryall and Sorenson 2007). Despite many theoretical approaches to this issue (Barabási and Albert 1999, Lin 2001, Madhavan et al. 1998, Sytch and Tatarynowicz 2014), research almost exclusively focuses on two means of network change: tie additions and, to a lesser extent, tie deletions. These tie changes allow the ﬁrm to manage resources through its own direct ties but provide no control over the ties of other ﬁrms. We consider another mechanism of network change that can provide such control: acquisitions. Fromanetworkslens,anacquisitionconsistsofthecol- lapse of two nodes by which the acquirer gains owner- ship of the target’s ties, which creates unique strategic possibilities for acquisitions and network change. These unique possibilities arise because node col- lapses have markedly diﬀerent properties compared with tie modiﬁcations (additions or deletions). Acqui- sitions can radically restructure the network by modi- fying multiple ties in a single transaction, constituting arevolutionarychangeinthestructurecomparedwith the more evolutionary change from tie modiﬁcations. Node collapses also have an impact on the existence and distribution of ties for nodes not involved directly in the acquisition, resulting in potentially strong net- work externalities, whereas changes in individual ties tendtoproduceeﬀectsmorelocalizedtothetwonodes forming or ending a tie. Furthermore, acquisitions allowactorstogaincontrolovertwotypesofresources: internal ones gained from ownership of the target’s resourcesandexternalonesgainedfrominheritingthe network ties of the target. The former may give rise to “internal synergies,” as discussed by previous merg- ers and acquisitions (M&A) research (e.g., Haspeslagh and Jemison 1991, Shaver 2006), while the latter may give rise to “network synergies,” a concept we intro- duce.Finally,manyﬁrmscanformatietoanotherﬁrm and access its resources, but only one entity can gain exclusive control over another by acquiring it. These diﬀerences allow ﬁrms to access and manage network resources in ways that tie additions or dele- tions cannot. Consider the following examples, which reﬂect the properties laid out in the previous para- graph. Node collapses provide access to networks in ways that tie additions could in principle accomplish butinrealityarehardtoachieve.Forinstance,suppose a ﬁrm could beneﬁt from being tied to a set of other ﬁrms. This ﬁrm could theoretically establish ties with allorseveralofthedesirablepartners.Butinreality,the ﬁrm may have insuﬃcient inﬂuence to form ties (e.g., low status) or the potential partners may not have the capacity or desire to initiate additional collaborations. Thesebarrierscanbeovercomethroughtheacquisition of a target that already is linked to some or all of the desirable partners, keeping the existing network intact 1652 Hernandez and Menon:Acquisitions, Node Collapse, and Network Revolution Management Science, 2018, vol. 64, no. 4, pp. 1652–1671,©2017 INFORMS 1653 but under new ownership. The externality-inducing eﬀect of acquisitions could be important in settings where ﬁrms compete for network positions, such as in high-technology industries where structural holes are valuable(Tatarynowiczetal.2016).Onestrategicmove in this context may be to undermine the networks of multiple rivals by eliminating their structural holes. While this may be possible (but hard to orchestrate) through a series of tie additions or deletions, it gives timeforrivalstorespondandneutralizethefocalﬁrm’s actions. By contrast, a node collapse has the advantage of speed by aﬀecting multiple rivals at once: a single transaction is more likely to aﬀect the ties of multiple actorsbeyondtheacquirerandtarget.Thesetwoexam- ples get at how node collapses can increase the odds of achieving a superior network position in a compet- itive environment by both enhancing the focal ﬁrm’s position and undermining that of its rivals. Furthermore, some strategically beneﬁcial network changes are only possible through node collapses. For instance, two ﬁrms may have ties to a similar set of partners, making them rivals for access to those part- ners’resources.Ideally,oneﬁrmwouldcausetheother to eliminate all redundant ties to increase the exclu- sivity of its position (Ryall and Sorenson 2007), but this is impossible because ﬁrms cannot control oth- ers’ ties. However, one ﬁrm can acquire the other and eliminate the overlapping ties because the acquisition grantslegalcontroloverthetarget’stiestotheacquirer. As a ﬁnal example, consider a cross-national scenario. Suppose a ﬁrm has valuable ties to a partner in a for- eigncountry.Becauseofgovernmentrestrictions,other ﬁrmsareunabletoalsoallywithoracquiretheforeign actor. A focal ﬁrm wanting access to the foreign ﬁrm’s resources could form a tie to the foreign ﬁrm’s part- ner. But a rival of the focal ﬁrm could do the same and thenbothwouldbecompetingforindirectaccesstothe desired resources. An acquisition of the partner of the foreignﬁrmbythefocalﬁrmhastwobeneﬁts:itgrants exclusiveaccesstotheforeignﬁrms’networkresources, anditeliminatestheoptionforarivaltoaccessthesenet- workresourcesbyformingatiewiththepartnerﬁrm. These cases illustrate some of the strategic possi- bilities aﬀorded by node collapses when it comes to accessing and protecting network resources. An addi- tional consideration is that acquisitions allow ﬁrms to also gain control over the internal resources of a tar- get,asextensivelydiscussedinpriorresearchonM&A (e.g., Haspeslagh and Jemison 1991, Shaver 2006). As mentioned earlier, a unique issue raised by node col- lapses is that ﬁrms may strategically consider both kinds of resources when making acquisitions. And because each acquisition is likely to vary in the extent to which acquirers are concerned with internal versus networksynergies,whichtypesofresourcesﬁrmspur- sue is important in explaining what kinds of network positionsﬁrmsmayseekviaacquisitionsandthushow networks evolve over time. Hence, the concept of node collapsesbringsnovelinsightstothestudyofbothnet- work dynamics and M&A. We systematically explore how node collapses impact the evolution of networks and the performance of organizations. As a baseline, we consider whether acquisitions are an eﬀective means for ﬁrms to obtain desired positions and improve performance. We focus on how collapses allow acquirers to improve access to resource-enhancing positions, such as centrality or structural holes (Anjos and Fracassi 2015, Buskens and Van de Rĳt 2008). We then study how node collapses produceexternalities—somepositive,somenegative— for the performance and network positions of those notdirectlyinvolvedintheacquisition.Finally,weana- lyze how the tension between seeking internal ver- sus network resources through node collapses aﬀects the evolutionary path of the network at both the ego and global levels (Lee et al. 2010, Tatarynowicz et al. 2016). Competition becomes a salient consideration when exploring these issues. The exclusive nature of acquisitions implies that multiple ﬁrms may simulta- neously be seeking similar network resources through nodecollapses,anditisnotclearwhattheimplications ofsuchbehaviorwouldbe.Hence,weexplorehowthe behaviors of individual ﬁrms seeking to acquire other nodes in a competitive context aﬀect the dynamics of the network. Since our objective is to observe the emergent prop- ertiesofthenetworkanddeveloptheoryratherthanto testspeciﬁchypotheses,weadoptasimulationmethod (Davis et al. 2007, Buskens and Van de Rĳt 2008, Tatarynowicz et al. 2016). In our multiperiod, multia- gent simulation, actors receive a payoﬀ in each period based on the amount of resource “bits” they accu- mulate (Reagans and Zuckerman 2008), which can be produced internally or accessed through the network. Acquisitions, or node collapses, allow the acquirer to gain control over the target, through which the acquirer can produce more internal resources, and to inheritthetiesofthetarget,throughwhichtheacquirer can access more network resources. These acquisitions involve a competitive bidding process. We allow the system to unfold until no more collapses occur and observe how ﬁrm performance and the properties of the network evolve at both the ego and global levels. Additionally, we build another simulation in which actors similarly pursue resources but can only add ties to one another to improve their network positions. We compare some of the main ﬁndings to those produced by the tie addition simulation. Weobservedaseriesofinterestingresults.Nodecol- lapses helped improve the performance of acquirers and,intheprocessofseekingmoreresources,resulted in higher centrality and greater access to structural Hernandez and Menon:Acquisitions, Node Collapse, and Network Revolution 1654 Management Science, 2018, vol. 64, no. 4, pp. 1652–1671,©2017 INFORMS holes for acquirers. These transactions tended to pro- duce positive externalities on the performance of othersbutnegativeexternalitiesontheircentralityand structural holes. When ﬁrms could only add ties, the impact on the network per transaction was signiﬁ- cantly weaker. The evolutionary path of the network dependedonwhetherﬁrmssoughtinternalornetwork resources. We explored three factors that modiﬁed the relative importance of the two types of resources: the cost of managing a large ﬁrm, getting at diseconomies of size (Coase 1937); the importance of obtaining dis- tant network resources, getting at the importance of novelty (Rosenkopf and Almeida 2003); and the fric- tions of resource transmission through the network, getting at the willingness of the ﬁrms to exchange resources with one another (Borgatti and Cross 2003). Thesimulationallowedustovaryeachofthesedimen- sions independently. When ﬁrms had inducements to favorinternalresources,thenetworktendedtobecome dominated by one or a few large ﬁrms and thus was characterized by high constraint at the ego level and low modularity at the global level. These tenden- cies were generally reversed with incentives to pursue network resources, with the network becoming more “egalitarian” and characterized by lower constraint andhighermodularity.Wealsofoundthatcertaincom- binations of cost, distance, or transmission produced intriguing nonlinearities in these eﬀects. We make several valuable contributions by intro- ducing a novel mechanism of network change. The ideathatacquisitionscan“collapse”nodesininterﬁrm networks raises the intriguing possibility of network revolution rather than incremental evolution from tie changes. We show that these collapses not only impact the focal acquirer but also produce network externali- ties for those uninvolved in the transaction. This sug- gests that the evolutionary path of a network modiﬁed through node collapses can have unique outcomes. To explainhowthatpathunfolds,wedistinguishbetween the internal versus external resource consequences of acquisitions. Scholars in the M&A literature have con- ceived of synergies as arising from the combination of acquirer and target resources that the ﬁrms own (Bradley et al. 1988, Capron and Pistre 2002). We raise thepossibilityofnetworksynergiesstemmingfromthe structuralrecombinationofthetiesofthemergingenti- ties, and we demonstrate that the direction of network evolution depends on which of the two types of syn- ergies ﬁrms pursue through node collapses. In doing so, we consider how competitive interactions shape the dynamics of both ﬁrm and industry networks. The ﬁndings raise novel strategic rationales for why ﬁrms makeacquisitionsandhowsuchactionsaﬀectnetwork change. Background Networks are composed of two basic elements: a set of nodes and an arrangement of ties among the nodes. Network change, at its most basic level, will involve the modiﬁcation of one or both of these elements. Prior work on social networks has tended to empha- size change driven by actors adding or deleting ties over time. While tie changes capture a large amount of the ongoing dynamics of networks, organizations are able to modify nodes in ways that individuals can- not. Two individuals cannot “merge” with each other from one period to the next, and so, for example, a friendship network can only change when ties are modiﬁed. By contrast, mergers and acquisitions are one of the most ubiquitous corporate strategies for growth and competition. Thus, in interorganizational networks, two nodes can “collapse” into one, creating an alternative avenue for network change. Because the concept is novel, we begin by providing some ground- ing in real examples of how node collapses may help ﬁrmsobtainresources. Node Collapses and Resource Access External ties are important when resources are widely distributed.1 In such settings, a ﬁrm’s network posi- tion impacts its performance by aﬀecting its access to resources(Lavie2006),andthesystemicpatternofcon- nections aﬀects the distribution of resources across the industry (Anjos and Fracassi 2015). These conditions are common, for instance, in technologically dynamic industries (Baum et al. 2000, Tatarynowicz et al. 2016) and for ﬁrms operating across foreign markets where resources are embedded in local and global networks (GhoshalandBartlett1990,Vasudevaetal.2013).When networks matter for performance, ﬁrms are likely to be aware of the implications that acquisitions have for their network positioning. One example is the 1999 acquisition of Allelix Bio- pharmaceutical from Canada by the U.S.-based NPS Pharmaceutical.Thedealannouncementconsidersthe combination of the preexisting alliances of both ﬁrms: “Research and development eﬀorts in the new orga- nization will include currently partnered programs... with Amgen and Kirin,... with SmithKline Beecham, ... with Eli Lilly,... with Janssen and... with Pharm- Eco. Proprietary clinical programs will be advanced by the new entity or partnered” (NPS Pharmaceuticals 1999). The mentioned partners came separately from thepremergernetworksofNPSandAllelix.Besidesthe combination of research and development (R&D) ties, the deal expanded the geographical reach of the two networksacrosstheU.S.andCanada:“NPSandAllelix said that as a combined entity, they will be able to take advantageoftheCanadianbiotechnologyindustryand its associated technical and ﬁnancial resources, ‘while reaping the beneﬁts of NPS’ US biomedical industry connections”’(The Pharma Letter1999). Hernandez and Menon:Acquisitions, Node Collapse, and Network Revolution Management Science, 2018, vol. 64, no. 4, pp. 1652–1671,©2017 INFORMS 1655 Another case is the 1998 purchase of GeneMedicine by Megabios. The acquisition was in part justiﬁed by how the combination of the two ﬁrms’ R&D networks was expected to be beneﬁcial: “Megabios has corpo- rate partnerships with Glaxo Wellcome... and with Eli Lilly.... GeneMedicine recently expanded its cor- poratealliancewiththeCorangeInternationalLimited subsidiary... ”inadditiontohavingotherpartnerships (Megabios Corp. 1998). The announcement further explains how the combination of these partnerships would help the new entity: “At the close of the merger, the combined company will have... [several] ongoing corporatepartnerships. ... [T]hisbusinesscombination should enable the combined company to leverage its collective scientiﬁc expertise, intellectual property and product development eﬀortsinto additional corpo- rate partnershipsandsuccessfulproducts ... ”(Megabios Corp. 1998, emphasis added). Referring back to some of the general cases from the introduction, NPS and Megabios could have—in principle—established ties to each of the ﬁrms mentioned in the acquisition announcements. But this may not have been possi- ble, and the purchase provided access to all partners through one deal. Thesenetwork-enhancingacquisitionsarefrequently contested because the acquirer’s rivals may seek to purchase the same target. For instance, when Inamed announcedtheacquisitionofCollageninAugust1999, it discussed its hopes to tap into Collagen’s “long- standing ties with cosmetic physicians,” but interest in purchasing Collagen was actually initiated when, ﬁve months earlier, Inamed’s rival Mentor “made an unsolicited bid to acquire Collagen” (Rundle 1999). A more recent example in a diﬀerent industry is VMware’s acquisition of Nicira. Cisco expressed con- cerns about how the combination would aﬀect its pre- existingalliancewithEMCaswellasaseparatealliance withCitrixandNetApp(Duﬀy2012).Competitionwas an important factor in this case because Cisco had attempted to acquire Nicira before VMware succeeded (Damouni et al. 2012). The contestation of acquisitions reﬂected in these cases gets at the issue of exclusiv- ity we considered in one of the examples from the introduction. A recent study suggests that the network implica- tions of acquisitions are more than anecdotal by de- monstratingthatdiversifyingdealshelpﬁrms“[bring] together information scattered across the economy,” which reduces the network distance between such information and provides performance advantages to diversiﬁedﬁrms(AnjosandFracassi2015,p.161).This underscores the importance of understanding how the mechanism of node collapse aﬀects ﬁrms’ acquisition strategies and how these strategies, in turn, aﬀect net- work change and evolution. Node Collapses vs. Tie Changes We see tie changes and node collapses as part of a tool kit that ﬁrms have at their disposal to modify their networks. Firms likely use diﬀerent actions for diﬀerent reasons or combine them according to their objectives. For example, some research shows that ﬁrms ﬁrst establish ties to evaluate potential acquisi- tion targets and then acquire some of those prospects (e.g., Higgins and Rodriguez 2006), and evidence sug- gests that such sequencing may improve acquisition performance (Porrini 2004, Zaheer et al. 2010). Tie deletions may help ﬁrms prune their networks of rela- tionships that no longer provide valuable resources, making room for subsequent additions or node col- lapses (Hernandez et al. 2015, Kleinbaum 2017). This underscores the fact that each type of network change mechanism has unique properties and is thus likely to produce distinct performance and network outcomes. Becauseextantworkhasmostlyfocusedontiechanges, and because the node collapse mechanism is novel to the literature, we focus this study on the unique prop- erties of node collapses and their implications for net- work evolution.2 From a networks perspective, node collapses have four characteristics that diﬀerentiate them from tie changes. Impact. Acquisitions allow a ﬁrm to access multiple relationships in one transaction—this, combined with theacquirer’sexistingties,canhelpthenewentitydra- matically change its standing in the network. What an acquisition accomplishes in one transaction in terms of adding new ties or removing redundant ties, a ﬁrm would have to replicate via multiple separate tie for- mation and deletion transactions. Figure 1 illustrates this with a highly stylized example. If ﬁrms A and B establish a tie, they each increase their degree by one unit. If they delete a tie, they decrease their degree by the same amount. But if A collapses with B and inher- its its ties, it increases its degree by three units. Hence, acquisitions have the potential to create network rev- olution rather than incremental evolution. While the diﬀerentialimpactpertransactionmayimplythatnode collapses are “supercharged” versions of tie additions or deletions (though that is not necessarily the case), theremainingpropertiesaremoreuniquetocollapses. Externalities. The structural consequences of an ac- quisition not only aﬀect the parties involved in the acquisition but also indirectly impact other parties. Returning to Figure 1, the collapse of A and B has a spillover eﬀect for those surrounding the acquirer and target (A1, B1, A3, and B3). For instance, A is able to increase its access to structural holes by becom- ing a broker between B1 and B2, B2 and B3, and A3 and B3 while A1 and B1 experience a decline in struc- tural holes—in fact, their ego networks become fully Hernandez and Menon:Acquisitions, Node Collapse, and Network Revolution 1656 Management Science, 2018, vol. 64, no. 4, pp. 1652–1671,©2017 INFORMS Figure 1.

Internal and External Resource Control.Research on M&A has focused on the internalization beneﬁts of such deals—namely, the ability of the acquirer to take ownership and thus control of the target’s resources. The literature uses the notion of synergy—a combina- tionofassetsthatproducesgreatervaluetogetherthan separate—to explain how much value can be created from the transaction (Bradley et al. 1988, Seth 1990). While the deﬁnition of synergy allows for any kind of resource combination, research has emphasized those stemming from resources owned by ﬁrms, which we label “internal synergies.”3 But when viewed from a networks perspective, acquisitions as node collapses also bring with them some degree of control (or at least more inﬂuence) over the target’s ties and thus enhanced access to external or “network resources” (Gulati1999).Forinstance,anacquirerfrequentlytakes over the contractual alliances of the target, as the biotechnology examples mentioned earlier show. Hence, value could stem from both the oft-studied internal synergies as well as what we labelnetwork synergies—the improvement in the acquirer’s network positionresultingfromthestructuralchangeinthenet- work because of a node collapse. In Figure 1, when A acquires B, it internalizes B’s resources but also gains access to novel external resources through ties to B1, B2,andB3.Tieformationsanddeletionsmodifyaccess to external resources only. We anticipate that much of the uniqueness of node collapses for the perfor- mance of actors and for the evolution of the network stemsfromtherelativeimportanceﬁrmsplaceoninter- nal versus external resources as they engage in node collapses. Exclusivity and Competition. Because ownership of resourcesusuallybringswithitdecisionrightsoverthe use of those resources, acquisitions provide ﬁrms with strong control over the target’s assets. While one could argue that some resources are more controllable than others (e.g., patents versus human resources, inter- nal versus network resources), node collapses provide greater control over another node’s resources than tie additions. While only one actor can acquire another, many actors can form a tie to the same partner. Such exclusivity underscores why, frequently, mergers hap- pen through competitive processes in which multiple suitorsoutbidoneanother.Thisexclusivityalsounder- lies many of the strategic possibilities that only node collapses can oﬀer (and not changes in ties), as illus- trated in some of the introductory examples. From a networksperspective,inasmuchasthefocalﬁrmseeks to obtain an improved network position through node collapses, so would others in the same network facing similar incentives (Salancik 1995). Research Goals We are interested in how acquiring another ﬁrm to obtain resources within a competitive context aﬀects the evolution of the network and the performance of network actors, whether directly involved in the node collapses or indirectly aﬀected by it. To reﬂect the issues raised by the properties of node collapses describedintheprevioussection,ourstudyfocuseson the following issues. Objective of the Network Actors. We explore how actors behave as they seek to accumulate resources, under the assumption that resources aﬀect perfor- mance. Firms may beneﬁt from both the amount and the novelty of resources they obtain, with networks being instrumental in accessing both (Rosenkopf and Almeida 2003). As in many real-world settings, actors can generate their resources internally or obtain them from their network environment. Node collapses are one way to gain additional resources, either by inter- nalizing another actor (and its resources) or by gain- ing additional ties by which to access others’ resources through network ties. Hernandez and Menon:Acquisitions, Node Collapse, and Network Revolution Management Science, 2018, vol. 64, no. 4, pp. 1652–1671,©2017 INFORMS 1657 Outcomes of Interest. We focus on outcomes at the ego and global levels. At the ego level, we explore two types of factors: ﬁrm performance and network properties. Performance is a function of the resources that ﬁrms obtain, and we observe both the amount and the novelty of resources to which ﬁrms have access. Because network positions are the means by which ﬁrms access external resources, we observe the centrality and the constraint of ﬁrms’ ego networks. Centrality is associated with inﬂuence and access to highresourceamounts(AnjosandFracassi2015).Con- straint is (inversely) associated with access to struc- tural holes, whereby ﬁrms gain novel resources from bridgingdisconnectedclusters(Burt1992,Buskensand Van de Rĳt 2008). Besides our interest in the level of these various factors for individual ﬁrms, we are also interested in their distribution (e.g., standard devia- tion) across ﬁrms in the network. This allows us to get at issues of performance and competitive advantage. At the global level, the community structure of the network is an important indicator of the structure of the industry (Tatarynowicz et al. 2016). Community structure focuses on the way in which ties are dis- tributed by capturing the modularity of the network. For instance, in industries with strong community structure, the network is composed of subgroups that are densely connected within but weakly connected to other groups (high modularity), whereas in industries with weak community structure, ties are more uni- formly distributed such that subgroups are not readily apparent (low modularity). Factors Aﬀecting Outcomes. At the most basic level, we are interested in observing whether node collapses impact the performance and network position of the focal actor and of third parties. Thus, the most basic factor we care about is the impact on the aforemen- tioned outcomes per node collapse. We are also inter- ested in observing how acquirers’ pursuit of internal versusnetworkresourcesaﬀectstheoutcomesofinter- est.Whileﬁrmsareunlikelytopursueonlyonetypeof resourcefromanacquisition,weconsiderthreefactors that aﬀect the relative inducements to pursue inter- nal versus external resources. We will discuss these parameters in signiﬁcantly more detail below, but we mentionthemheretoconceptuallymotivatethemodel parameters. First, the cost of being a large ﬁrm will impose lim- its on the value ﬁrms can create from absorbing many nodes through acquisitions (Shaver and Mezias 2008). Growing large through mergers allows ﬁrms to have high rates of internal resource production, but when thecostofsizegoesup,thescalesaretippedinrelative disfavorofinternalresources(Coase1937).Second,the payoﬀ to obtaining resources from “distant” parts of the network may be valuable in settings where novelty is an important aspect of performance (Rosenkopf and Almeida 2003). When incentives to pursue such dis- tant resources are strong, ﬁrms will tend to favor net- work resources over internal ones. Third, relational or competitive factors may create frictions in the ﬂow of resources through network paths (Borgatti and Cross 2003, Hernandez et al. 2015). This will aﬀect the need to engage in node collapses to access resources. When frictions are low, acquiring other ﬁrms is less valu- able because network resources are easily available; when they are high, acquiring other ﬁrms to internal- ize resources becomes a more valuable strategy. Model Because our objective is to observe emergent proper- ties of the network to develop theory, we do not pro- vide hypotheses like in a traditional empirical study. We instead follow a simulation approach, which has advantages over formal analytical modeling in our case.Ananalyticalmodelwouldentailsolvingahighly complex multiperiod problem involving many inter- actingstrategicagents.Toachieveaclosed-formanalyt- ical solution for such a system, the underlying model would have to be simpliﬁed to such an extent as to lose many crucial aspects of the problem. For instance, to bring the computational requirements to manage- ablelimits,onemightlowerthenumberofactorstoan extremely small number, reduce the number of peri- ods (perhaps to even just two), impose very strong symmetric conditions across the players, and intro- duce other strong simplifying assumptions. But since we are interested in how networks of a large num- ber of agents change over many periods, leading to signiﬁcant asymmetries along the way, we opt for the simulation approach. We expect that the results of the simulation can be subsequently tested empirically. Simulation Structure The simulation executes the following steps: Step 1. We initialize a random Erdős–Rényi (1959) network withn nodes and probabilityp that any two nodes are linked to one another. We set the network sizeto25nodesbecausethecomputationalcomplexity isformidableandincreasesexponentiallywiththesize of the network. Initially, all ﬁrms have a “size” of one node.Astheyacquireotherﬁrms,acquirersinternalize the nodes of targets and thus grow in size, deﬁned as the number of nodes possessed by the ﬁrm. Step 2. Each node produces a “bit” of resources everyperiodthatisvaluableforallﬁrms(Reagansand Zuckerman2008).Theﬁrmthatownsanodehasaccess to the resources it produces with a probability of 1 (Anjos and Fracassi 2015). Resources can get transmit- tedtootherﬁrmsthroughnetworkties.Theprobability that a ﬁrm receives a resource through network trans- mission decreases the farther away it is in the network from the ﬁrm that owns the node that produced the Hernandez and Menon:Acquisitions, Node Collapse, and Network Revolution 1658 Management Science, 2018, vol. 64, no. 4, pp. 1652–1671,©2017 INFORMS resource (i.e., it decreases in the shortest path length between the two ﬁrms). A “transmission” parameter, tr ∈[0,1],determineshowmuchfrictionthereisinthe ﬂowofresourcesthroughthenetwork.Theprobability that a ﬁrmi obtains access to resources from ﬁrmj is then given bytr splijt , where splijt is the shortest path length from ﬁrmi to ﬁrm j at timet. Thus, attr /equalx0, there is an inﬁnite amount of friction, and no resource transmission occurs over the network. Astr increases, the resources start to ﬂow more freely, up totr /equalx1, whereeveryﬁrm j thathassomenetworkpathtoﬁrm i is guaranteed to access its resources. If a ﬁrm has no network path to another, it cannot receive resources vianetworktransmission.Thus,themorenodesaﬁrm owns(i.e.,thelargeritssize),themoreresourcesitwill produceinternallyandhaveguaranteedaccesstoevery period. The more ties it possesses, the greater will be the chances of accessing resources through network transmission. The smaller the shortest path length to other ﬁrms, the greater the likelihood of accessing net- work resources. As we discuss in more detail later,tr aﬀects ﬁrms’ inducements to pursue internal versus network resources. Step 3. The objective of each actor is to maximize its performance, which is a function of the resources to which it has access at a given point in time. The proﬁt for actori in periodt is given by πit /equalx ∑ j (rijt ×(spl ijt +1)d)1.5 −c(sizeit )2. (1) The ﬁrst term of the equation captures the positive eﬀect of resources, while the second term captures the negative eﬀect of ﬁrm size. We describe each term in turn. On the resource side, rijt is the amount of resources ﬁrmi has access to from ﬁrmj in periodt, splijt is the shortest path length from ﬁrmj to ﬁrm i in period t, and d is a parameter that captures how muchthedistancethattheresourcehastravelledacross the network impacts performance. Thus,(splijt + 1)d can be thought of as a distance-based weighting fac- tor for the amount of resources, such that low values (e.g., d /equalx0) represent situations in which performance is driven solely by the amount of resources accessible by the ﬁrm, while high values (e.g.,d /equalx1) represent cases in which resources that come from far across the networkaremorevaluable.Notethatif i /equalxj,wedeﬁne splijt /equalx0, meaning that the distance-based weighting will be 1 for one’s own resources, irrespective of the parameterd.Theexponentof1.5capturesaworldwith increasing returns to scale (results are robust to using othervalues >1).Inaworldwhereonly“internal”syn- ergies mattered (i.e., no resources are available from the network), for an acquisition to create more value than the status quo and thus, for both parties to ﬁnd an agreeable price, one would need such increasing returns.SincepriorliteratureonM&Afocusesonvalue created through internal synergies, we use an increas- ing returns setup as our default, but we do consider simulation outcomes for decreasing returns as well. On the cost side,sizeit captures the number of nodes “owned”byﬁrm i inperiod t,and c isaparameterthat determines how much ﬁrms are penalized for being large. When c /equalx0, there is no penalty for absorbing nodes through acquisitions. Asc increases, ﬁrms are disincentivized from internalizing nodes to guarantee access to their internal resources, tipping the scales in relative favor of network resources. While Equation (1) has several components, we can reduce it to a very simple function where only the amount of resources aﬀects performance by settingd /equalx0 and c /equalx0. As we explore the results, we always begin with this simple structure and later explore the implications of adding distance and cost considerations. Step 4. At the beginning of each period, a ﬁrm is picked at random to choose a potential acquisition target. The chosen ﬁrm goes through the list of all remainingﬁrmsinthenetworkand,foreachﬁrm,eval- uates the expected payoﬀ that will accrue to it if it weretoacquirethatﬁrm.(Notethattheﬁrmcalculates the expected value of the payoﬀ since the transmis- sionofresourcesthroughthenetworkisaprobabilistic process.) An acquisition causes the acquiring ﬁrm to inheritthenode(s)ofthetargetaswellasitsties,result- ing in a new network.

V A−VU will be the maximum that the ﬁrm will be willing to pay for the target.

Atthesametime,thetargetwillacceptabidonlyifthe bid is larger than the payoﬀ it would get if it rejected the bid and stayed a separate entity (VT). Thus, the acquirer identiﬁes the target that produces the highest V A−VU and, ifV A−VU >VT, makes a bid for that target. (In this setup, a bid can happen only if the joint value that is created by the acquisition is larger than thevaluecreatedbytheﬁrmsremainingseparate,con- sistent with the classic notion of synergy.) To simplify the bidding mechanism, we will assume that a ﬁrm always bids the maximum that it is will- ing to pay for a target. The bidding mechanism can be thought of as being similar to a second-price sealed- bid auction, where the winner of the auction pays the second-highestbidforthetarget(FudenbergandTirole 1991).Thiscouldresultinsomesituationswhereavery Hernandez and Menon:Acquisitions, Node Collapse, and Network Revolution Management Science, 2018, vol. 64, no. 4, pp. 1652–1671,©2017 INFORMS 1659 small ﬁrm (say, an isolate) could acquire a much larger ﬁrm—an unrealistic scenario. To rule out such cases, we impose a constraint that the acquirer cannot bid on targets that are more than 150% of its own size. (The results are robust to relaxing this constraint, as dis- cussed later.) Thus, the acquirer makes the bid for the target producing the highestVT −VU given this con- straint. In case no targets satisfy the constraint and/or generate a positiveVT −VU, the ﬁrm simply does not make a bid, and the period ends with all ﬁrms receiv- ing payoﬀs based on the existing network structure. An important issue is what level of rationality we assume acquirers have when evaluating potential targets. Bounded rationality suggests that ﬁrms are unlikely to observe and evaluate large numbers of potential acquisition targets. While this would become a signiﬁcant issue in a general model with a large number of nodes (since actors evaluate all ﬁrms in the network), the network size in our current setup is kept rather small (25 nodes including the focal ﬁrm) and shrinks with each node collapse. This implicitly keepsthecomputationalcomplexitymanageablewith- out requiring extreme levels of cognitive capability. Step 5. Once the focal ﬁrm has made its bid, the remaining ﬁrms in the network (except the target for whom the bid has been made) enter into a competi- tivebiddingprocessforthatpotentialtarget.Following the same logic as the focal ﬁrm above, they each sub- mit a bid. Once all bids are entered, the ﬁrm with the highest bid wins the target, pays the price oﬀered by the second-highest bidder (as explained above), and the acquisition is completed. The network is recon- ﬁgured to reﬂect the acquisition. The fact that others become aware of the acquirer’s intention of merging with the target is borne out by prior research (e.g., James and Wier 1987) and illustrated by some of our earlier examples. Step 6. At the end of the period, all ﬁrms receive a payoﬀperEquation(1)reﬂectiveofthestateofthenet- work at that point in time. We assume that the ﬁrm pays oﬀ all of its proﬁts for the period to its “share- holders” at the end of each period, and thus we avoid aﬀectingthedynamicsduetointertemporalissuesthat might result from ﬁrms carrying over proﬁt balances. Step 7. Steps 2–6 are repeated for a certain number of periods until we observe convergence (i.e., no more node collapses are occurring, as discussed below). A variety of metrics are calculated at the end of each periodtoassesshowthenetworkisevolvingovertime. In addition to the primary simulation, focused on node collapses, we generated an additional simulation in which actors could only add ties to each other. This served as a comparison for some of the results of the main simulation. The tie addition simulation is iden- tical to the main one in Steps 1–3 and Steps 6 and 7. Instead of Steps 4 and 5, where the acquisition target is selected, a ﬁrm is randomly chosen to establish a tie with another node. The focal ﬁrm considers all pos- sible new partners and picks the one that maximizes the objective function, subject to the condition that the new partner’s performance is also better oﬀ by estab- lishing the tie.4 When comparing tie additions to node collapses, we setc /equalx0 to avoid assumptions about the relative costs of forming ties versus acquiring nodes that could drive any diﬀerences in the comparison. Measurement As mentioned earlier, we track a variety of metrics to assess how node collapses aﬀect the performance of ﬁrms and the structure of the network. The descrip- tionofthesimulationprovidedtheformulaformetrics such as performance, resource amounts, or resource distance. The network measures of interest are as follows. Ego Level. We capture the degree centrality of each actor as the number of ties it possesses in each period (Wasserman and Faust 1994). We follow prior work by measuring structural holes based on network con- straint (Burt 1992): ci /equalx∑ j(pij + ∑ q piq pq j)2,i , q , j, where pij istheproportionof i′stotalnetworktiesrep- resented byj, piq is the proportion ofi′s total network ties represented byq, and pq j is the proportion ofq′s total network ties represented byj. Recall that low val- ues of constraint represent networks rich in structural holes while high values capture networks with high closure or density. Global Network. We capture community structure using Girvan and Newman’s (2002) approach to ﬁnding the modularity of the network, asQ /equalx1/e ·∑ k (ekk −{ekk }),where e isthetotalnumberoftiesinthe network, ekk is the number of ties in thekth commu- nity, and{ekk }is the expected average number within the communities in the network. There are many algo- rithmicapproachestoestimating Q,ofwhichweadopt the “Louvain” approach (Blondel et al. 2008) because it has been shown to have a good balance of accuracy and computational eﬃciency (Fortunato 2010). Results We organize our analysis into three parts that fol- low the conceptual claims of the paper. First, we brieﬂy show that node collapses meaningfully aﬀect theperformanceandnetworkstructureoftheacquirer. Second, we explore the eﬀects of node collapses on ﬁrms not directly involved in the transaction (i.e., net- work externalities). Third, we consider how factors that motivate actors to pursue internal versus network resources (d, c, andtr ) aﬀect the evolution of the net- work structure. For the results presented below, we initialized a network of 25 nodes with default values of tr /equalx0.5 and ofp /equalx0.15, corresponding to a realistic Hernandez and Menon:Acquisitions, Node Collapse, and Network Revolution 1660 Management Science, 2018, vol. 64, no. 4, pp. 1652–1671,©2017 INFORMS scenarioofarelativelysparseinterﬁrmnetworkwitha moderate likelihood of resource transmission through network ties. Furthermore, for the baseline results, we set c /equalx0 and d /equalx0—that is, a world where there are no costs of being large and where only the total amount of resources matters for proﬁt (and not the distance- weightedamount).Wesubsequentlyvarytheseparam- eters to assess their individual eﬀects on the evolution of the network. Eachsimulationwasrepeated1,000timesforarange ofseveralvaluesoftheparametersofinterest.Thecom- putational complexity is formidable. In each period, a ﬁrm must assess the future payoﬀ to an expected net- work for each potential acquisition target. If the ﬁrm makes a bid on a target, all other ﬁrms must make a similar calculation. This process repeats itself in each timeperiod,andthesequenceofstepsruns1,000times for every single parameter value of interest. Obtaining the results reported below took a signiﬁcant amount oftime—multipledays—onaHighPerformanceCom- puting Cluster. The computing time scales exponen- tially with the number of nodes in the network. Convergence. We consider the simulation to have reached convergence when no more node collapses occur (or they occur very infrequently) because actors do not deem they can proﬁt anymore from acquiring others.Figure2(a)depictsthenumberofﬁrmsremain- inginthenetworkaftereachperiodforthedefaultcase (p /equalx0.15, tr /equalx0.5, c /equalx0, d /equalx0). As expected in a world with increasing returns to scale, when there is no con- straint on ﬁrm size, the network eventually shrinks to a few nodes that have absorbed all others. This hap- pens after roughly 400–500 periods (not necessarily at the rapid pace one would expect, as we will discuss shortly). The pattern of network shrinkage remains with slight variations in cases wherec and d vary, as we will discuss later. Also, network shrinkage occurs but is delayed in supplemental models with moder- ate rates of new ﬁrm entry and reverses in models where the rate of entry is high. However, the relation- ships between the parameters of interest, discussed in moredetailbelow,donotchangemuchwhenweallow for entry. Hence, we present our main results without entry but discuss their sensitivity to entry later. The main objective of our study is to understand the dynamics of the network and how certain parame- ters aﬀect those dynamics, rather than to observe con- vergence or equilibrium structures. Once the network reaches a steady size, observations do not reﬂect how node collapses aﬀect the network anymore. Thus, the focus of the results that follow will be on the periods when collapses are occurring. Baseline Themostbasicclaimofthestudyisthatnodecollapses are an eﬀective means for ﬁrms to achieve network- related objectives. We explored the average impact of Figure 2(a).

We observed that degree centrality generally increased for the acquiring ﬁrm with each node collapse in Figure 2(c), such that actors increased Hernandez and Menon:Acquisitions, Node Collapse, and Network Revolution Management Science, 2018, vol. 64, no. 4, pp. 1652–1671,©2017 INFORMS 1661 Figure 2(d).

However, in latestages(period >300),acquisitionsslightlydecrease degreecentrality,amechanicalartifactoftheextremely small network size at that point. Network constraint in Figure 2(d) generally declined with each transaction, suggesting that the pursuit of network resources was associated with increasing access to structural holes. Onceagain,theexceptionwasthatconstraintincreased inverylateperiodsbecause,bythatpoint,thenetwork isextremelysmallandactorsaredenselylinkedtoeach other. In the tie addition simulation, degree centrality increased and constraint decreased on average, but the rate at which they did so was much smaller compared with the node collapse simulation (graphs depicting this shown later). To illustrate how node collapses aﬀect the evolution of a global network property, Figure 2(e) shows that the modularity of the network decreases over time. This means that the process of competitive node col- lapsestoobtaingreateramountsofresourcesleadstoa decreasing number of distinct clusters in the network. Theresultsreportedinthissectionremainqualitatively unaltered in a model where entry occurs. We summa- rize as follows. Result 1. Node collapses undertaken by ﬁrms in a compet- itive context to increase resource access will tend to increase the degree centrality and decrease the constraint of the focal ﬁrm.Theywillalsoleadtoalessmodularnetworkovertime. Recall that our default simulation is one with increasing returns to scale on the amount of resources accessed by ﬁrms. Thus, it was designed to give signif- icant incentives to acquire, consistent with the concept of synergy. In a world where only internal resources existed, one should expect this system to collapse very quickly to a single ﬁrm that has acquired everyone else—especially in a small network starting with only 25 nodes. Instead, we see a gradual decrease in the number of acquisitions; that is, the collapsing force of the increasing returns is resisted by a competing force—namely, that of network synergies. As the net- work evolves over time, the relative importance of net- work synergies increases, slowing the rate of network collapse at an increasing rate.5 Thus, in a world of increasing returns to scale, network synergies provide aforcethatbalancesagainstrapidorcompletenetwork collapse. By contrast, in a world of decreasing returns to scale, ﬁrms would rather remain separate if the only resources available were internal ones because an acquisition would actually destroy total value. How- ever, allowing for network synergies in this world can actually cause some ﬁrms to undertake acquisitions driven by the possibility of increasing access to net- work resources to an extent that more than compen- sates for the value loss due to decreasing returns. We can see this in Figure 2(f), which tracks the total num- ber of ﬁrms remaining in the network in a decreasing returns world, where the exponent on the resources term in the proﬁt function was changed from 1.5 (default) to 0.75. Thus, network synergies can actually facilitate node collapses and network shrinkage, while therewouldbenoneintheirabsenceunderdecreasing returns to scale. Result 2A. In a world of increasing returns to scale, net- work synergies can ameliorate the tendency of ﬁrms to quickly acquire others, slowing network shrinkage. Hernandez and Menon:Acquisitions, Node Collapse, and Network Revolution 1662 Management Science, 2018, vol. 64, no. 4, pp. 1652–1671,©2017 INFORMS Result 2B. In a world of decreasing returns to scale, net- work synergies can facilitate node collapses and lead to net- work shrinkage. For the rest of the results, we focus on the default simulationofincreasingreturnstoscalebecausethatis the typical scenario in M&A, where internal synergies are valuable. Externalities The next claim of the study is that node collapses have a signiﬁcant impact on actors not directly involved in the transaction. We will consider externalities through a series of plots, each comparing the total externality, meaning the average impact of the node collapse on all ﬁrms except the acquirer and target, to the average impact of a node collapse on the acquirer. WebeginwithperformanceinFigure3(a).Nodecol- lapsestendtohaveapositiveeﬀectontheperformance oftherestofthenetwork,andthiseﬀectdecreasesover time.Collapsescreatepositiveexternalitiesfortworea- sons. First, they allow the acquirer to internalize and control one additional “bit” of resources, and thus the acquirer will transmit more of its internal resources to those to whom it is linked. Second, collapses tend to shrink the distance between the target’s partners and Figure 3(a).

The inheritanceofnewconnectionsthroughnodecollapses is more likely in earlier periods, when the network is sparser, explaining why the positive externality tends to decline over time. Figure 3(d) compares the perfor- mance externality produced by node collapses to that produced by tie additions. To make the two compara- ble,wescaledtheperformanceproducedbyeachsimu- lationbythesizeofthenetwork(recallthatthenetwork shrinkswithnodecollapsesbutnottieadditions). 6 The graph shows that node collapses produce signiﬁcantly stronger positive performance externalities (per ﬁrm) than tie additions. Note also that the eﬀect on the focal ﬁrm is much stronger for node collapses. Result 3A. Node collapses tend to create a positive exter- nality on the performance of the other actors. Figure 3(b) shows the negative externality of node collapses on degree centrality. The degree centrality of a third party (i.e., neither acquirer nor target) can neverincreaseafteranodecollapsebecausesuchtrans- actions do not create new ties in the network—they only reassign the “ownership” of existing ties. Degree Hernandez and Menon:Acquisitions, Node Collapse, and Network Revolution Management Science, 2018, vol. 64, no. 4, pp. 1652–1671,©2017 INFORMS 1663 will decrease only when the third party was tied to the two merging nodes. The reason that the external- ity becomes increasingly negative over time initially is that, as the network becomes less modular and denser with time (see Figure 2(e)), the odds of third-party ties among dyads increases too. Hence, collapses will decrease the degree of other actors more with time. However, in the later stages, the externality gradually becomes less negative as there are fewer ﬁrms remain- ing and thus fewer common third-party ties. (In the very late stages, when the focal ﬁrm itself decreases its degree centrality with every acquisition, the negative eﬀect on others could be argued to be a positive exter- nality, though we view this as an unrealistic scenario.) Figure 3(b) also contrasts this result with the degree of externality produced by the tie addition simulation. Each new tie mechanically increases the focal ﬁrm’s degree by one tie, but there is no externality: the new partneralsoincreasesitsdegreebyonetie,butnoother ﬁrms are impacted. Result 3B. Node collapses create a negative externality on the degree centrality of actors. Figure 3(c) depicts the externality eﬀect of node col- lapses on network constraint. Recall that constraint consistently declined as a result of node collapses for the acquirer seeking more resources (see Figure 2(d)), so the increase in constraint for all others is therefore a negative externality (except, once again, when the network shrinks to a very small size in late stages). The reason node collapses produce increases in con- straintforotherswhenthefocalactorseekstodecrease constraint is best illustrated by referring again to Fig- ure 1. If A and B establish a tie, they both increase in structural holes (more precisely, decrease in con- straint). But that transaction has no eﬀect on A1 or B1—their constraint value remains the same as before (A1 spans a structural hole between A and B1, while B1 spans a structural hole between B and A1). By con- trast, if A acquires B and inherits its network, there are two eﬀects. First, A’s structural holes will increase (constraint decreases). Second, there will be a negative spilloveronA1andB1becausethe“collapse”ofAand B causes them to not span structural holes anymore— they are now part of the fully closed triad A–A1–B1. Thus, node collapses tend to indirectly close the net- worktiesofpartiesformerlyaﬃliatedwiththeacquirer and target, resulting in decreased constraint—at least in scenarios in which actors seek to increase structural holes through collapses. Figure 3(c) also contrasts the constraint externalities produced by node collapses to those generated by tie additions. While both actions decrease the focal ﬁrm’s constraint, collapses do so much more strongly. Interestingly, additions produce a slightly positive constraint externality (by increasing others’ access to structural holes), whereas collapses produce a strong negative externality. Result 3C. Node collapses create a negative externality on thestructuralholesofotheractors/parenleft.upi.e.,increasesothers’con- straint/parenright.upwhenthefocalactorseekstoincreasestructuralholes /parenleft.upi.e., decrease its own constraint/parenright.up. Internal vs. Network Synergies We expect that whether ﬁrms pursue internal or net- work resources through node collapses will have dis- tinct eﬀects on how the network evolves. We focus on three parameters that allow us to vary the relative importance of internal and network resources. We ﬁrst explain how each parameter aﬀects actors’ valuation of internal versus network resources and summarize that explanation in an “observation.” Then, we show howtherelevantparameteraﬀectsavarietyofnetwork attributes, consistent with the observation. Because these considerations are unique to node collapses (tie additions or deletions have no impact on ﬁrms’ access to internal resources), a tie addition simulation cannot be compared to a node collapse simulation for this set of ﬁndings. Diseconomies of Size. The ﬁrst parameter of interest is the cost incurred by the ﬁrm in managing an inter- nal portfolio of nodes, which applies only to actors that absorb others and internalize their resources. By deﬁnition, the direct performance increase that results from gaining control over another actor’s internal resources declines as cost increases. Observation 1. As cost increases, the value of internal resources relative to external resources decreases. We capture the implications of this observation in a variety of outcomes. The plots in this section have the outcome of interest on the vertical axis, the parameter ofinterest onthehorizontal axis,andthree linescorre- sponding to diﬀerent preconvergence time periods in the simulation (early (period/equalx20), middle (100), and late (400)). Hence, eﬀects over time can be seen across the lines. One clear emergent pattern is that, under very low cost, the network becomes dominated by one or a few large ﬁrms that absorb many nodes because theinternalresourceincentivesoverpowerthenetwork resource incentives—something similar to a “monop- olist” eﬀect. As cost increases, this tendency changes and gives way to a more “egalitarian” network com- posed of several medium ﬁrms because the relative valueofexternalresourcesgoesup.Thiscanbeseenin various results. Figure 4(a) shows that the number of ﬁrmsremaininginthenetworkincreaseswithcost(i.e., fewer node collapses happen as cost increases), while it decreases over time. Figure 4(b) shows that the stan- dard deviation in the average ﬁrm size decreases with cost and, when cost is low, increases dramatically over timeasmorenodecollapseshappentoproducehighly nonegalitarian structures with one or a few large cen- tral ﬁrms and a few small peripheral ﬁrms.

At the ego level, we observeinFigure4(c)asigniﬁcantdeclineinconstraint (a move toward more open networks) as cost rises. When cost is low, constraint increases over time rather quickly, while this increase is much lower as cost rises. Consistent with this, Figure 4(d) reveals that at the global level, modularity increases as cost rises because cost prevents a “monopolist” from devolving the net- work into a single component, although modularity decreases over time as already shown in Figure 2(e).

Distance. The second parameter that aﬀects the rel- ative value of internal and external resources is the impact on performance of the distance traveled by the resources to which the ﬁrm has access, embodied ind.

Observation 2. As inducements to pursue distant resources increase, the value of external resources rel- ative to internal resources increases. We will focus on two main patterns. The ﬁrst is the expected eﬀect of network actors having a dis- incentive to shrink the network too quickly because it eliminates the beneﬁts of having access to distant resources (“dispersion” eﬀect). The second eﬀect is slightly counterintuitive: because ﬁrms get a perfor- mance boost as a result of the distance factor, tar- gets that would not have been attractive based on the amount of resources alone are now able to clear the acquisition hurdle rate because they bring with them accesstonetworkresources,whosevalueincreasesas d increases(“hurdlerate”eﬀect).Thishurdleratemecha- nismtakeseﬀectmainlyinlateperiods,afterdealsthat wouldhaveeasilyclearedthehurdlerateanywayhave already been done. Also, it applies under signiﬁcantly high values ofd because the performance boost from even very small network synergies is strong enough to makedealsworthwhile.Thedispersioneﬀectwillslow down the shrinkage of the network, while the hurdle rate eﬀect will slightly facilitate it. We present a series of plots supporting these ideas.

Figure 5(b) shows that the standard devi- ation of ﬁrm size tends to decline ind, moving the network to a more “egalitarian” structure, but it tends to rise again at very highd in late periods. The disper- sion and hurdle rate eﬀects are also manifested in the structure of the network. Figure 5(c) depicts the aver- age constraint of the network actors, which tends to decline ind. Furthermore, constraint initially declines over time (from period 20 to period 100) at very high d because structural holes are particularly attractive because of the high value placed on distant or novel resources. But at very highd and in late stages, the hurdleratetakeseﬀectandpushesthenetworktoward higher constraint. Finally, Figure 5(d) shows the eﬀects of distance on modularity. As expected, the impor- tance of distant network resources pushes the network toward higher modularity initially asd increases.

Transmission. The ease with which resources ﬂow through network ties aﬀects the eﬃcacy of node collapses and, through that mechanism, the relative importance of internal and network resources. We embodythefrictionstoresourceﬂowsinthe tr param- eter. At one extreme, in a world with insurmount- able frictions (tr /equalx0), no resources make it to the ﬁrm through network paths—that is, no network resources are available. Here node collapses are crucial because Hernandez and Menon:Acquisitions, Node Collapse, and Network Revolution 1666 Management Science, 2018, vol. 64, no. 4, pp. 1652–1671,©2017 INFORMS they are the only means by which resources possessed by other actors can be obtained. But these resources can only be gained through internalization; collapses do not provide access to network resources. As fric- tions to resource transmission ease to moderate levels (e.g., tr /equalx0.5), internal resources become less cru- cial as network resources become increasingly avail- able and important. Under these conditions, collapses become useful to access network resources because theyallowtheacquirertoshortenthedistancebetween itselfandvaluableresourceproviders.Astransmission increases, therefore, internal resources become rela- tively less important than network resources. At the other extreme, in a perfectly frictionless world (tr /equalx1), all resources in the network arrive to the focal ﬁrm as long as there is a path to the resource owner. Here, internalizing resources has no value except when a node collapse allows the ﬁrm to take control of or link to a previously disconnected actor. At the same time, network resources are guaranteed to arrive, so node collapses are not valuable to obtain these either. Thus, we have the following. Observation 3. As transmission increases, the avail- ability of network resources relative to internal resources increases. Observation 3A. As transmission increases, the rela- tiveimportanceofnodecollapsesasameansofacquir- ing internal resources decreases. Observation 3B. As transmission increases, the rela- tiveimportanceofnodecollapsesasameansofacquir- ing network resources increases initially and then decreases. Thus, transmission should aﬀect the evolutionary pathofthenetworkininterestingways.Becausetrans- mission aﬀects both internal and network resources simultaneously per Observations 3, 3A, and 3B, vary- ing transmission alone makes it hard to isolate the two types of resources. However, because increases in cost suppressthepayoﬀtopursuinginternalresourcesonly (per Observation 1), we compare the eﬀects of trans- mission across low and high values of cost (c /equalx0 and c /equalx1, respectively). We note that the eﬀects are highly similar whether ﬁrms are pursuing only resource amounts (d /equalx0) or distance-weighted amounts (d >0), so we present only the results for the former. Fig- ure 6(a) shows that, under low cost, the number of ﬁrms remaining increases as transmission increases. Note that in the absence of any network synergies at tr /equalx0, the increasing returns to scale of our simulation quicklyforcethenetworktocollapseintoasingleﬁrm, providing further evidence of how the network syn- ergy was the force that was keeping the network from collapsing before (see Result 2A). Under high cost, the importanceofinternalresourcesissuppressed,andwe Figure 6(a).

Figure 6(b) demonstrates that in the initial periods, the distribution of ﬁrm size becomes more egalitar- ian as transmission increases in a low-cost regime, whereas it exhibits a nonlinear pattern under a high- cost regime—with the most unequal distribution at moderate values of transmission. Note, however, that under the low-cost regime and at very low transmis- sion levels, the strong incentives for resource internal- ization drive the network to very quickly devolve into a single ﬁrm, as was seen in Figure 6(a) as well.

Figure 6(d) plots the eﬀect of transmission on the modularity of the network. We observe that modularity increases over transmission when cost is low but that it exhibits the expected non- linear relationship in which modularity is lowest at moderate transmission levels when cost is high. Result 6A. As transmission increases in a low-cost sce- nario, fewer node collapses happen, the network is character- ized by a more egalitarian distribution of small to medium- sized ﬁrms, and the network evolves toward a less con- strained and more modular structure. Result 6B. As transmission increases in a high-cost sce- nario, the number of node collapses initially increases and then declines, the egalitarianism of the network initially decreases and then increases, the constraint of ego networks initially increases and then decreases, and the modularity of the network initially decreases and then increases. Robustness Tests The ﬁndings remain qualitatively similar in a series of additional tests. We conducted simulations allowing for diﬀerent rates of entry of new ﬁrms into the net- work. These simulations had two important features: (1) the rate of entry was determined by a probability that one new ﬁrm entered the network in each period (we ran models ranging from 10% to 30%), and (2) the new entrant was endowed with the average number of ties of the initial network (determined byp). The relationships between the key parameters (c, d, and tr) and the outcomes of interest remained qualitatively similar. The only diﬀerence, unsurprisingly, is that the point of convergence (i.e., no more deals are happen- ing) happens later as the entry rate increases and that the network increases in size over time when the entry rate is high. One arguably strong assumption we made in the main models is that the acquirer inherits all of the network ties of the target. The beneﬁts of node col- lapses may dissipate if ties are lost systematically. To address this, we introduced a parameterm that cap- tures the proportion of the target’s ties that remain postacquisition (i.e., a fraction1 −m ties of the target are randomly dropped). In the main simulation, the default value ofm /equalx1. We found substantively similar results using 0.50 and 0.75 as alternative values. We reasoned that losing more than half the ties is unlikely inmostscenarios.Whilewedonotexpectthe m param- eter to embody all scenarios under which ties may be lost, it helps provide a sense that the results are robust to at least one assumption of tie loss. We also checked the sensitivity of the results to the assumptionthatﬁrmscannotacquiretargetsthatmore than1.5timeslarger.Werelaxedthisconstraintbyrun- ning models allowing acquirers to purchase targets up to2and3timesaslarge,aswellaswithoutrestrictions on target size. The results are, once again, qualitatively similar. Discussion This paper studied an underexplored mechanism of network evolution based on changes in nodes. We focused our attention on some of the key features of this mechanism that make it distinct from changes in network ties. In this section, we comment on some of the main patterns that emerged from the simulation andtheirimplicationsforresearchonnetworks,acqui- sitions,andorganizations.Wealsoattempttoexplicitly point out empirically testable implications as we dis- cuss the main patterns. A unique aspect of node collapses is that they allow ﬁrms to both internalize a target’s resources and increase access to a target’s network resources. M&A research has long focused on the former but not explicitly considered the latter. We suspected that the relative importance of pursuing internal versus network resources through acquisitions would have a signiﬁcant bearing on the direction of network evolu- tion. The general pattern is that conditions motivat- ing ﬁrms to pursue internalization of resources lead Hernandez and Menon:Acquisitions, Node Collapse, and Network Revolution 1668 Management Science, 2018, vol. 64, no. 4, pp. 1652–1671,©2017 INFORMS to networks dominated by a monopolist and struc- turally characterized by low modularity at the global level and high constraint at the ego level. By con- trast, conditions motivating ﬁrms to pursue network resources lead to a more egalitarian distribution of small to medium ﬁrms, where the network is struc- turally characterized by high modularity and low con- straint.Empiricalworkcouldtesttheseimplicationsby observing how heterogeneity in the types of resources ﬁrms seek through M&A activity aﬀects the structure of interﬁrm networks. These patterns from the sim- ulation were revealed by varying three factors that aﬀect the relative weight placed on the two types of resources: the cost of being a large ﬁrm, the value of distantresources,andtheeaseoftransmissionthrough network ties. Each of these parameters map onto real- worldapplicationsandimportantempiricalliteratures. Incentives to pursue resource amounts versus distance-weighted resources may correspond to dif- ferent types of industries. In settings where resources are not very diﬀerentiated and performance is driven by size or market power (e.g., oil, transportation), ﬁrms may be more motivated to pursue high resource amounts. We note that such industries are, consistent with our ﬁndings, characterized by higher levels of concentration (akin to a “monopolist” eﬀect) and tend to place less emphasis on external collaboration. By contrast, in industries where diﬀerentiation and inno- vationaremoregermanetoperformance(e.g.,biotech- nology, electronics), the network distance of resources maybeimportant.Thoseindustriesalsoshownetwork patternsconsistentwithourﬁndingsbecausetheytend toplacemoreimportanceonexternalcollaborationand thus have larger networks of ﬁrms interacting with each other. Consistent with this latter observation, we found that node collapses produce negative externalities on the structural holes spanned by ﬁrms, which are frequently associated with access to novel resources (Burt 1992). This speaks to the issue of innovation through networks, which is of interest to many schol- ars (Ahuja 2000, Phelps et al. 2012). In empirical work, Tatarynowicz et al. (2016) demonstrated that ﬁrms are more likely to pursue structural holes as the techno- logicaldynamismoftheindustry(aproxyfortheneed for novelty) rises. A study motivated by the concept of node collapses could take this a step farther and test whether ﬁrms select acquisition targets that enhance access to structural holes in technologically dynamic industries but prefer those that enhance network den- sity in technologically stable industries. Thetransmissionparameterappliestoseveralempir- ical examples of factors aﬀecting the process of interorganizational knowledge transfer. The nature of the relationships between network participants is one such factor, with trust facilitating resource ﬂows (Zaheer et al. 1998) and competition impeding them (Hernandez et al. 2015). The institutional context also plays a role because it aﬀects partners’ mindsets and motivations to share knowledge (Powell et al. 2005, Vasudevaetal.2013).Thenatureoftheresourcesbeing exchanged (e.g., tacit versus codiﬁable) is also relevant (Szulanski 1996). Any of these could impact transmis- sion and provide empirical scenarios in which to test a common implication of our simulation: as the fric- tions to knowledge ﬂows via networks are high, ﬁrms are more likely to engage in acquisitions versus tie for- mation to obtain desired resources. These empirical scenarios could also be used to test whether settings with increasing knowledge transfer frictions aﬀect the density and modularity of interﬁrm networks. Our exploration of the cost parameter revealed an intriguing result that speaks to the literature on ﬁrm boundaries. The network does not simply devolve to a single, massive ﬁrm because the beneﬁts of network synergies countervail the incentives of purely internal production (Result 2A). Coase (1937) suggested that ﬁrms would not grow indeﬁnitely large because dis- economies of size would make managing extremely large organizations challenging. We indeed observe this eﬀect—as cost increases, the network stops short of collapsing to a single ﬁrm. But we also observe that, even in the absence of diseconomies of size (c /equalx0), ﬁrms do not grow indeﬁnitely due to the value of net- work resources. This provides an additional limit on ﬁrm size not anticipated by transaction cost theories. Empirical research could get at issues surrounding the cost of ﬁrm size by taking advantage of technologi- cal transitions that make vertical or horizontal integra- tionmoreorlessvaluable,andsuchresearchcouldsee whether the pattern of eﬀects on network dynamics (and the choice to use acquisitions to collapse nodes) holds in real-world data. While node collapses have signiﬁcant eﬀects on the networks of acquirers, one of the hallmarks of this mechanism is the strong externalities it imposes on actors not involved in the transaction. We found posi- tiveexternalitiesonperformanceandnegativeoneson centrality and access to structural holes. This is some- whatparadoxicalbecausethetwostructuralproperties enhance access to resources. In our simulation, acqui- sitions always increase the potential resources avail- able to others because they increase the resources of acquirers,whointurnaremorelikelytotransmitmore to those they are connected to. Hence, even if they worsenothers’structuralpositions,acquisitionsdonot decrease access to resources and thus improve oth- ers’ performance. We recognize that this may not be realisticbecauseactorsarelikelytodiﬀerentiallytrans- mitnetworkresourcestoothersdependingonwhether they are collaborators or rivals (e.g., Hernandez et al. Hernandez and Menon:Acquisitions, Node Collapse, and Network Revolution Management Science, 2018, vol. 64, no. 4, pp. 1652–1671,©2017 INFORMS 1669 2015). Future work could develop this with more nuance than we have. Because node collapses only happen in interorga- nizational networks (not in interpersonal ones), they most commonly occur through mergers and acquisi- tions. Hence, the ﬁndings have signiﬁcant repercus- sions for the literature on that subject. Only recently have network considerations begun to seep into the literature (Anjos and Fracassi 2015). We introduce the important idea that acquisitions, by collapsing nodes, generate two kinds of synergies: internal ones based on owned resources and network ones based on rela- tional resources. The increasing returns conditions of the model produced outcomes consistent with inter- nal synergies as discussed by prior work—ﬁrms have strong reasons to internalize others to become more productive. But as we illustrated with some of the introductory examples, understanding node collapses provides an explanation for acquisitions not consid- ered previously. We suggest three types of deals uniquely motivated bynodecollapses.Theﬁrstwouldhelptheﬁrmrapidly improve its network position in a way that tie changes cannot. This may be the case when a single acquisition provides the ability to tie with many new partners at onceatalowercostthanseparatelyestablishingformal or informal ties to eachdesirable new partner. The sec- ond type of deal would be motivated by imposing an externality on other network participants. Our results provided one example: ﬁrms can eliminate the struc- tural holes of others through node collapses, which may limit their ability to access novel resources. The third type of deal would be motivated by control, such asblockingarivalfrompartneringwithavaluabletar- getorprotectingabitofvaluableknowledge.Thismay happen,forinstance,whentheﬁrmwantstoeliminate a rival from the network to reduce competition for a certain network position (e.g., take out a structurally equivalent node). Each of these cases cannot be explained by the con- cept of internal synergy alone. Indeed, node collapses may help explain otherwise odd deals where no sig- niﬁcant owned assets seem to be in play. This may be helpful in addressing the perennial issue of why ﬁrms engage in acquisitions despite evidence that the stock market reacts negatively to them (Giliberto and Varaiya 1989, Haspeslagh and Jemison 1991). Perhaps considering network synergies may explain variance in acquisition performance above and beyond inter- nal synergies and even identify cases in which net- work synergies compensate for negative internal ones. Webelievethatfutureempiricalworkcoulddocument the various kinds of synergies to understand diﬀerent sources of value for acquirers. For instance, the dif- ﬁculty of relying on tie formation to access desirable network resources varies across ﬁrms with low ver- sus high status. Because the former may not be able to control tie formation as much, perhaps they rely on acquisitions more than high status ﬁrms to gain access to network ties. Or a study getting at the externalities created by node collapses could assess whether ﬁrms involved in innovation races, where preventing rivals from accessing novel ideas is crucial, engage in acqui- sitions oﬀering few internal synergies but producing high negative network externalities (such as closing others’ structural holes). While the application that motivated our initial interest in node collapses is mergers and acquisitions aﬀectinginterﬁrmalliancenetworks,themechanismof node collapse occurs in other settings. Within an orga- nizational context, reorganizations frequently involve the combination of departments or other subunits to streamlineoperations.Theseeventscanbeconceptual- izedasnodecollapsesthatalterthestructureofformal andinformaltiesamongemployeesandreassignrights andresponsibilitiesoverintraorganizationalresources. Marriages may have some features of node collapses because they combine the assets (social and economic) of families and allow access to new social groups. The degree of instrumentality we assume in corporate mergers may not apply to many modern marriages, butinthepast,marriageshaveservedsigniﬁcantpolit- ical and economic roles that may be understood from a node collapse angle (Padgett and Ansell 1993). Not alloftheassumptionswehavemadeinoursimulation may apply to these other instances of node collapses. Earlier wedescribed a testindicating thatthe results are robust to node collapses resulting in a loss of a certain fraction of ties chosen at random. It might be the case that the loss of target ties is nonrandom but instead skewed toward exactly those ties that bring in certain types of resources. These would be impor- tant boundary conditions of our results. Some previ- ous research has shown that ﬁrms may lose client ties in nonrandom ways after a horizontal merger (Rogan 2013,RoganandGreve2014),andRoganandSorenson (2014) bring up the fact that sometimes the social capital embodied in organizational networks is con- trolledbyindividualsratherthanorganizations,which may lower the eﬃcacy of node collapses in obtaining desired resources. This may be captured in the low transmissionscenarioofourmodelifwhatindividuals do is reduce ﬂows between ﬁrms. Given the novelty of node collapses to research on network change, we felt it was important to focus on a world in which that is the only process at play, with a simple comparison to tie additions for some of the primary results. One limitation of the study is that we have put aside other mechanisms by which the net- work evolves: (1) tie deletions, (2) entry and exit of nodes,and(3)nodesplitting(e.g.,divestitures).Ajoint Hernandez and Menon:Acquisitions, Node Collapse, and Network Revolution 1670 Management Science, 2018, vol. 64, no. 4, pp. 1652–1671,©2017 INFORMS studyoftheseprocesseswouldbeavaluablenextstep, with several issues worth addressing. At a basic level, comparing the impact of the various mechanisms on speciﬁc outcomes can provide a sense of which means are most eﬀective in helping ﬁrm accomplish certain goals. One issue in such a study could be the rela- tive cost of various types of mechanisms in producing a desired outcome. For instance, a single tie addition or deletion is likely to be less expensive than a node collapse or split. Another issue may be under what conditions certain mechanisms may be functionally equivalent, such as when a strong tie may be as useful for resource access as a collapse and when it may not. As we mentioned earlier, these mechanisms are likely toworktogetheraspartofatoolkit.Understandingthe sequencingofvariousactionswouldbeimportant—for instance, ﬁrms may divest to make room for network renewal and then use a combination of additions and mergers to obtain new resources. Wehavepointedoutthatnodecollapseisafrequent occurrencebutthatitseﬀectsonnetworkevolutionand onacquisitionstrategyhasbeenunexplored.Giventhe prevalence of acquisitions and the documented eﬀects of network positions on ﬁrm performance, exploring the implications of this mechanism has theoretical and practical value. Because a single collapse transaction can have a much larger impact on the network com- pared with tie additions or deletions, it has the ability to produce network revolution rather than incremen- tal change. Moreover, node collapses uniquely allow ﬁrms to access both internal and external resources, and which of the two resources ﬁrms pursue impacts the direction of network evolution. A few of the eﬀects of these issues were glimpsed in the results of this paper, but the subject raises many implications that remain to be studied.

Endnotes 1We deﬁne resources broadly as including any tangible or intangi- ble factors that may aﬀect ﬁrm performance. We are interested in resources that can be transferred or accessed through network ties (e.g., Gulati 1999, Lavie 2006), so factors such as machinery that do not move through networks are beyond the scope of this study. While the bulk of networks research tends to focus on information or knowledge, and such resources may be the dominant type that ﬂows through networks, we use the broader term “resources” for generalizability. 2See Hernandez and Menon (2016) for a study of the eﬀect of multi- ple network change mechanisms, including tie and node changes. 3Existing work on market power has also considered “external” consequences of acquisitions, such as eliminating a rival or taking greater control over suppliers (Devos et al. 2009). Or a transaction mayalsoimpacttiestoclients(e.g.,RoganandSorenson2014).While the focus of those studies is on external considerations, here we are concerned with eﬀects on the structure of the ego and global networks in which the acquirer is embedded, and the performance implications thereof. 4We did not generate a tie deletion simulation because the objective functioninourcasedoesnotcreateanyincentivestoremoveties,and itwasimportanttousecomparableobjectivesacrossthesimulations. 5Backing for thispoint comes fromFigure 6(a), to bediscussed later, whenallnetworksynergiesareturnedoﬀattransmissionlevelsof0. In that scenario, given the absence of a network force to counter- act internal synergies, we do indeed see that the network rapidly devolvesintoasinglelargeﬁrmdrivenbyincreasingreturnstoscale. 6This scaling is necessary when it comes to comparing performance because the total amount of network resources changes with the number of ﬁrms in the network. Hence, performance comparisons across node collapse and tie addition simulations are not meaning- ful without scaling. This is not an issue when comparing structural metrics such as degree and constraint (see Figures 3(b) and 3(c)).
