How do ﬁrms manage to collude without communicating? Why do we ﬁnd more collusion in price competition than in quantity competition? Why is collusion so hard to detect? We examine strategic behavior in competitive interactions by developing and applying the concept of virtual bargaining. When decision makers virtually bargain, theymentallysimulate,andchooseamong,agreementsthattheycouldreachiftheywere able to explicitly negotiate with each other. Virtual bargainers focus on agreements that oﬀer some protection against the possibility that their counterparts may deviate and best respond to these agreements. We develop a formal account of virtual bargaining and demonstrate that it leads to collusion in Bertrand, but not in Cournot, competition. In this framework, collusion is a result of virtual bargaining as a mode of reasoning and requires neither communication nor dynamic considerations, such as rewards and punishments, between the players.

Introduction Antitrust authorities are increasingly prioritizing the detectionandpunishmentofpriceﬁxing.However,itis often very diﬃcult to ﬁnd concrete proof of wrongdo- ing,“withevidencehardtospotfromtheoutside”( The Economist 2016). It appears that collusion frequently occurs with minimal or no communication among competitors.Recentreportssuggestthateveninonline markets—where sellers are decentralized and may not know one another—there are often unspoken agree- ments not to undercut prices (Ungoed-Thomas and Lord 2016). Antitrust authorities typically need evi- dence of explicit discussion to punish colluding com- petitors.Therefore, unspokenagreements areparticularly problematic. How is such collusion possible? Why is it so hard to detect? The problem of collusion is, of course, long stand- ing.Inafamouspassagein TheWealthofNations ,Smith (1937, p. 128) notes that, “People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diver- sion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices.” We suspect that the problem of unspoken agreements also has a long history. Such agreements, while intuitively plausible, may seem incompatible with basic theory: collusion in oligopolistic markets without communi- cation does not easily follow from Nash equilibrium and,hence,isdiﬃculttoanalyzeusingstandardgame- theoretical tools. Finding direct evidence for the oper- ation of unspoken collusive agreements in real mar- kets is inevitably diﬃcult, precisely because they are unspoken. But the existence of unspoken agreements is consistent with evidence from experimental mar- kets, where participants’ behavior often diverges from Nash predictions. This phenomenon is especially pro- nouncedforcompetitioninprices,ananomalythathas been coined the “Bertrand paradox” (e.g., Engel 2007, Fatasetal.2014,Friedman1977,KrepsandScheinkman 1983, Suetens and Potters 2007). Moreover, puzzling collusive behavior exists even in the absence of learn- ing and experience eﬀects (Dufwenberg and Gneezy 2000). The divergence between Nash predictions and observedbehaviorismuchsmallerornonexistentwhen ﬁrms compete in quantities (see Potters and Suetens 2013foranoverview). 5599 Melkonyan, Zeitoun, and Chater:Collusion in Bertrand vs. Cournot Competition 5600 Management Science, 2018, vol. 64, no. 12, pp. 5599–5609,©2017 The Author(s) The present paper oﬀers a novel explanation for col- lusive behavior in oligopolistic markets. We build on a concept of strategic behavior calledvirtual bargain- ing (Misyak et al. 2014), originally developed to model joint action and communication in cognitive science. Thehumanabilitytoengageinvirtualbargainingsug- gests that actors merely need to imagine a bargaining process: they can directly implement the results of a purely “virtual bargain,” without actually needing to communicate, when it is clear what the outcome of such a conversation would be. Crucially, this is pos- sible even in one-shot interactions in the absence of learning and reputation eﬀects. According to the vir- tualbargainingviewpoint,Smith’sconcernthatsellers’ conversations soon turn to collusion against the con- sumercanbebroadened.Collusivebehaviormayoccur even if the conversation can merely be imagined. More concretely, we propose a formal deﬁnition of a virtual bargaining equilibrium that helps explain how playersmaycoordinateoncollusiveoutcomes.Accord- ingtothistheory,playersidentifyagreementsthatthey couldpotentiallyreachiftheycouldenterintobinding contracts (we use “agreement” and “strategy proﬁle” interchangeably).Theyrealize,however,thatgiventhe nature of their interaction, these agreements are not enforceable. Speciﬁcally, for each possible agreement, each player considers two scenarios for the opponent’s behavior. Under the ﬁrst scenario, the opponent sticks to the agreement, whereas under the second, she1 best responds to the agreement. The players perceive strategic uncertainty as to which of these two options the opponent will choose. To model attitudes to strategic uncertainty, we sup- pose that the players are strategically pessimistic: each player uses the lowest of the payoﬀs under these two scenarios, called the worst payoﬀ, to guide his behavior. This behavior can be rationalized using the maxmin model of ambiguity aversion (Gilboa and Schmeidler 1989). A player retains a strategy proﬁle (called “feasible agreement”) if its worst payoﬀ cannot be improved by a unilateral change of strategy. For- mally, it turns out that the set of feasible agreements is equivalent to the set of Nash equilibria on the worst payoﬀs (as opposed to the payoﬀs). The set of feasi- ble agreements contains all Nash equilibria and often includes additional strategy proﬁles. After identifying the set of feasible agreements via a mental simula- tion, the players envisage a bargaining process and choose a strategy proﬁle from the set of possible fea- sible agreements. The strategy proﬁle selected via this procedure is called the virtual bargaining equilibrium. It exists under standard regularity conditions and, in many games, the set of virtual bargaining and Nash equilibria diﬀer. The rationale for the virtual bargaining equilibrium can be illustrated in a domain that we do not directly consider here: the puzzling question of the justiﬁca- tion of mixed-strategy Nash equilibria. Consider the game of Matching Pennies, where each of two players chooses heads, tails or amixedstrategy (i.e., selecting a probability of choosing each option). One of the play- ers receives a payoﬀ of 1 if the pennies match and a payoﬀ of−1 if they do not match, whereas the other playerreceivesapayoﬀof −1inthecaseofamatchand a payoﬀ of 1 in the case of a nonmatch. Here, the equi- libriumisthatbothplayerschooseheadsandtailswith probability ½. But if player 1 chooses this mixed strat- egy,player2cancostlesslychooseanystrategy(includ- ing playing heads with probability 1). But if player 2 chooses any other strategy, player 1’s½, ½ strategy is not a best response. So there appears to be something unstable about the justiﬁcation of both players playing the mixed strategy: if one does so, the other need not, and then the next iteration of reasoning leads to apure (nonprobabilistic) strategy. This puzzle disappears when one adopts a virtual bargaining point of view.2 That is, if we ask, “Which feasible agreements are there in matching pennies?”, the answer is that there is just one, the mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium proﬁle. From a virtual bargaining perspective, this agreement is stable becauseif each player follows it, their worst expected payoﬀ is zero (irrespective of any “best response” the other makes— of course, here all responses from the other are tied). Anyotheragreementhasastrictlysmallerworstpayoﬀ (e.g., if player 1 agrees to play heads, then whatever player 2 might supposedly agree, her best response— say tails—will lead me to a certain loss.) Both players can reason that the mixed-strategy agreementistheonlyonethattheycancrediblyachieve (any opponent who promises that they will play a spe- ciﬁcmovecanonlybeattemptingtobluﬀ,ordouble-,or triple-... bluﬀ). According to virtual bargaining, each playerisconﬁdentthatsheherselfwillfollowthe“bar- gain” (here, the mixed strategy), whether or not the otherdoes.Thus,incontrasttoNashreasoning,players strictlyprefermixedstrategiesundervirtualbargaining reasoning; not just in Matching Pennies, but more gen- erally.Thus,virtualbargainingprovidesasimplejusti- ﬁcation for mixed-strategy equilibria, as an alternative to highly sophisticated and controversial proposals in theliterature,suchas“puriﬁcation”(Harsanyi1973). Here, we use the virtual bargaining equilibrium in a diﬀerent context: to explain and predict the poten- tialforcollusivebehaviorinBertrandcompetition(i.e., ﬁrms compete on prices) and Cournot competition (i.e., ﬁrms compete on quantities). These two models of competition are central to understanding markets and business strategies (e.g., Cabral and Villas-Boas 2005). Our predictions require neither communication nordynamicconsiderations(forcollusioninadynamic environment, see, e.g., Campbell et al. 2005). Melkonyan, Zeitoun, and Chater:Collusion in Bertrand vs. Cournot Competition Management Science, 2018, vol. 64, no. 12, pp. 5599–5609,©2017 The Author(s) 5601 Consider Bertrand competition with diﬀerentiated goods and two players (Singh and Vives 1984, Stigler 1964). Suppose that each player envisions a collu- sive virtual agreement involving higher prices. Each player realizes that the opponent will have an incen- tive to choose a price below the collusive level. In spite of the possibility of this deviation, the collusive outcome is more attractive than Nash—both players may make high proﬁts even if one deviates from the agreement and undercuts the other. Moreover, there exists an agreement that each player ﬁnds more attrac- tive, in terms of her worst payoﬀ, than all agreements resulting from her own deviations. This agreement involves a higher price than the Nash equilibrium of the game. Thus, virtual bargaining enables the players to collude and achieve higher proﬁts than in the Nash equilibrium. To gain further insights into this ﬁnding, consider theTraveler’sDilemmagame(Basu1994).Inthisgame, two players simultaneously and independently choose a sum of money—e.g., an integer sum between $1 and $100. Both players receive the lower of the two sums; then $2 is transferred from the player who gave the “greedier” oﬀer to the player with the more “mod- est” oﬀer (no transfer occurs if both players propose thesamesumofmoney).Thismeansthateachplayer’s best response is to slightly undercut the other, and an inductive argument leads to a single Nash equi- librium: that both players choose $1 and receive this very low payoﬀ. Thus, although both players have a great deal to gain from coordinating on a high num- ber(e.g.,bybothchoosing$100),theNashequilibrium predicts that this opportunity will be lost. Collusion in thisgameamountstochoosingahighersumofmoney. As might intuitively be expected, in experiments, peo- ple are often able to coordinate, reasonably eﬀectively, to obtain high payoﬀs in this game (Capra et al. 1999). Consider a virtual agreement that stipulates that both playerschoose$100.Ifaplayerstickstothisagreement, and her opponent either follows the agreement or best responds to it, then the least that she can get is $97. This worst payoﬀ of the strategy proﬁle ($100, $100) is thus much more attractive than a payoﬀ of $1 under the Nash equilibrium. It is also more attractive than otherpotentialcollusiveagreements.Thus,virtualbar- gaining leads to collusion at the highest possible level in this game (i.e., full collusion). In Bertrand compe- tition, however, we show that the virtual bargaining equilibrium lies strictly between the Nash equilibrium and the price vector that maximizes the total of the two players’ proﬁts. Thus, virtual bargaining leads to partial collusion. The reasoning that enables the players to collude in the Traveler’s Dilemma and Bertrand competition has similarities. In both cases, the incentive to under- cut the other player exists, but it is not too detrimen- tal to the opponent. Moreover, if one player chooses a higher price/number, the opponent’s best response is tochooseahigherprice/numberaswell(butnottothe same degree), thus moving in the direction of a collu- sive outcome. As a result, there exists a strategy pro- ﬁle that improves on Nash and oﬀers some protection against the possibility that the opponent may deviate and best respond to the agreement. In contrast, virtual bargaining does not have a bite in Cournot competition. If one of the players contem- platesareductioninquantity,sherealizesthatitwillbe met by an oﬀsetting increase in the opponent’s quan- tity, if the latter chooses to best respond. Thus, when one of the players considers moving toward a more collusive outcome, she realizes that the opponent will move in the direction of higher market dominance. In contrast to Bertrand competition and the Traveler’s Dilemma game, Cournot competition is not conducive to collusive behavior. Our analysis of implicit collusion envisions collu- sive behavior as emerging spontaneously and implic- itly. Unlike explicit regulations or laws, the implicit agreements that guide social and economic behavior are typically not written down or subject to formal sanction. People appear, nonetheless, to be averse to violating implicit agreements. This aversion has been observed in “breaching” experiments where people are instructed to violate everyday social rules (e.g., Garﬁnkel 1967, Milgram and Sabini 1978). Such aver- sionmaybeampliﬁedwherethereisexplicitconsentto an agreement—e.g., through an unenforceable “hand- shake” (Kessler and Leider 2012). Indeed, the desire to conform to implicit agreements can motivate behavior (Krupka et al. 2017). Moreover, the tendency to fol- low implicit agreements tends to “spill over” between contexts(PeysakhovichandRand2016).Implicitagree- ments may do more than guide behavior merely by imposing additional costs and beneﬁts in a conven- tionalutility-maximizinganalysis.AccordingtoMarch and Olsen’s (2008) inﬂuential theory, such agreements haveanentirelyseparate“logic”forguidingaction(for example,accordingtodeontologicalratherthanconse- quentialist theories of ethics, see Kamm 2007). While following implicit agreements can be seen as a foundation for virtue, it can also operate against the public interest, as in the case of collusion. Here, the implicit nature of the agreement may be particularly advantageousforcolludingparties,becauseanexplicit agreement might violate the law. In cases where it is “obvious”tobothpartiesthatfollowingtheagreement (e.g., keeping prices high) will be mutually beneﬁcial, explicit agreement may not be required. Both parties may know what theywould agree, if they were able secretly to communicate.

Virtual Bargaining Equilibrium Consider a game between two players, 1 and 2, who simultaneously and independently choose their strate- giesσ1 ∈Σ1 andσ2 ∈Σ2.3 Letui(σi ,σ−i)denoteplayer i’s (i /equalx1,2)payoﬀ function, where player i’s opponent is denoted by−i and the latter’s strategy is denoted by σ−i. We deﬁne the worst payoﬀ of an agreement (σA 1 ,σA 2 )for playeri /equalx1,2 as the worst-case scenario of two possibilities: (i) playeri’s opponent goes through with the agreement by playing her part of the strategy proﬁle (σA 1 ,σA 2 )and (ii) best responds toσA i . Formally, the worst payoﬀ of an agreement(σA 1 ,σA 2 )is given by wi(σA i ,σA −i)/equalxmin { ui(σA i ,σA −i), sup σ−i ∈R−i (σA i ) ui(σA i ,σ−i) } , (1) where R−i(σA i ) denotes the set of player −i’s best responses to strategy σA i . Thus, player i allows for the possibility that player −i will deviate from the agreement (σA i ,σA −i)and play a best response to strat- egy σA i . Note that playeri also believes that among all such best responses, player−i will choose the best response that yields player i the highest payoﬀ. In otherwords,eachplayerbelievesthatevenifheroppo- nent deviates from an agreement, she will not do so in a spiteful fashion. This assumption is common in many strategic environments. Examples include bar- gaining models, principal–agent models, and ultima- tum games. In these environments, the party that re- ceives an oﬀer is indiﬀerent between accepting and refusing it but chooses the former, which in turn bene- ﬁts the party making theoﬀer. The assumption of non- spitefulnessensuresthatthesetoffeasibleagreements includesallNashequilibria.However,thisassumption does not inﬂuence the analytical results in the present paper,becauseinCournotandBertrandgamesthebest response to any strategy is unique. The players will be guided by worst payoﬀs if they have ambiguous beliefs about the strategies that their opponents will play and if their preference functional has Gilboa and Schmeidler’s (1989) maxmin expected utility form. Suppose that for each strategy proﬁle, each player entertains two possibilities for his oppo- nent’s behavior: “the agreement is honored” or “the opponentbestrespondsinanonspitefulfashion.”Sup- pose also that each player has completely ambiguous beliefs about which of these two strategies will be played by the opponent (or, equivalently, each player considers each possible probability distribution over these two strategies). If a player with such beliefs has maxmin expected utility preferences, then his prefer- ence functional will be given by (1).4 Each player thinks of all strategy proﬁles as possible agreements that she could strike with her opponent; andforeachsuchagreement,herchoicesareguidedby the worst payoﬀ. The two players narrow down the set of all possible agreements and retain the agreements where neither player can improve her worst payoﬀ by aunilateraldeviation.Wecalltheseagreements“feasi- ble.” Formally, we will say that an agreement(σF i ,σF −i) is feasibleif, for alli ∈{1,2}, wi(σF i ,σF −i)≥wi(˜σi ,σF −i), for all˜σi ∈Σi . (2) The intuition is that a feasible agreement(σF 1 ,σF 2 )is an arrangement that the two players could both credibly have reached if there is no bargain(˜σ1,σF 2 )that would have a better “worst payoﬀ” for player 1; and similarly, there is no bargain(σF 1 ,˜σ2)that would have a better “worst payoﬀ” for player 2. Thus, each player uses the worst payoﬀ function both when the player considers following an agreement and when she considers devi- ating from it. If an agreement is not feasible, then the two players discard it as a possible mode of behavior because at least one of the players has a more attrac- tive alternative agreement (from the perspective of her worst payoﬀ). In a world where players focus on “payoﬀs,” uni- lateral deviations imply that players are looking for higher individual payoﬀs: such deviations can poten- tiallyleadtoexploitationoftheotherplayer.Inaworld where players focus on “worst payoﬀs,” however, uni- lateral deviations have a diﬀerent meaning. The ques- tion is not whether each player can deviate by best responding, thereby potentially exploiting the other player. Instead, the players consider unilateral devia- tions to ﬁgure out whether there is a more attractive agreement for them than the focal agreement. Let RF i (σ−i)≡ arg maxσi ∈Σi wi(σi ,σ−i)denote player i’s best-response correspondence for the worst payoﬀ function.Usingthisnotation,theagreement (σF i ,σF −i)is feasible if and only if σF i ∈RF i (σ−i), for alli ∈{1,2}. (3) Thus, our notion of a feasible agreement is equivalent to the Nash equilibrium, but in a world of “worst pay- oﬀs”ratherthan“payoﬀs.”Thatis,feasibleagreements ensurethatno“moreattractive”agreementsareattain- able through unilateral deviation. Therefore, it seems that for both players to consider a strategy proﬁle as a candidate for a virtual bargain, it has to be feasible. Note that a game may have multiple feasible agree- ments.Welet F denotethesetoffeasibleagreements.It follows immediately from the deﬁnition in (1) that any Nash equilibrium (NE) is a feasible agreement. How- ever, there may be feasible agreements that violate the Nash requirements. We use the symmetric game of Table 1 to demon- strate the concepts introduced above.5 Table 1(a) con- tains the normal form of the game, while Table 1(b) contains the worst payoﬀs for all pure-strategy pro- ﬁles. In this game, each playeri /equalx1,2 has three pure Melkonyan, Zeitoun, and Chater:Collusion in Bertrand vs. Cournot Competition Management Science, 2018, vol. 64, no. 12, pp. 5599–5609,©2017 The Author(s) 5603 Table 1.Illustrative Game Player 2 Player 1 H L N (a) Normal form of the game H (60,60) ( 33,62) (− 10,61) L (62,33) ( 36,36) (− 6,40) N (61,−10) ( 40,−6) ( 0,0) (b) Worst payoﬀs for pure strategies H (33,33) ( 33,−6) (− 10,0) L (−6,33) (− 6,−6) (− 6,0) N (0,−10) ( 0,−6) ( 0,0) strategies: H, L, and N. The set of pure-strategy fea- sible agreements consists only of the Nash equilib- rium strategy proﬁle (N,N). In addition, the game has a feasible agreement in mixed strategies where each player plays strategy H with probability 6 7 and strategy N with probability 1 7 . To demonstrate that the latter strategy proﬁle, which is denoted by ((H,6 7 ; N,1 7 ), (H,6 7 ; N,1 7 )), is a feasible agreement, we verify thatsupσ−i ∈R−i ((H,6/7;N,1/7))ui((H,6 7 ; N,1 7 ),σ−i)/equalx34. Since ui((H,6 7 ; N,1 7 ),(H,6 7 ; N,1 7 ))/equalx50.3, the worst pay- oﬀ for the strategy proﬁle((H,6 7 ; N,1 7 ), (H,6 7 ; N,1 7 ))is equal to 34. One can also demonstrate that any unilat- eral deviation from this agreement yields a worst pay- oﬀ that is (weakly) smaller than 34. Thus,((H,6 7 ; N,1 7 ), (H,6 7 ; N,1 7 ))is feasible. Moreover, this strategy proﬁle is the only feasible agreement in addition to the Nash equilibrium(N,N). The example in Table 1 also illustrates that the sup- port of feasible agreements may include strictly dom- inated strategies. The strategyH is strictly dominated by the strategy L for both players. However, H is played with probability6 7 in the mixed-strategy feasi- ble agreement. The rationale for virtual bargaining, which we ex- plained in the introduction, implies that the players entertain the possibility that the opponent will stick to the bargain and playH. Given that virtual bargainers may not best respond and may even play strictly dom- inated strategies, one might refer to virtual bargaining as a form of “bounded rationality.” Within economics, bounded rationality is sometimes used as a general term for nonstandard, behavioral accounts to explain experimental ﬁndings “while retaining precision and cross-game generality” (Camerer et al. 2003, p. 194). In cognitive science, however, “bounded rationality” can generate misleading associations. Inspired by Her- bert Simon, cognitive scientists typically use bounded rationality to refer to approximations to rational pro- cesses, which are “bounded” by computational limita- tions.Althoughvirtualbargainingmakesassumptions that deviate from Nash reasoning, it does not assume computational restrictions. Instead, virtual bargaining assumesthatplayersthinkofstrategyproﬁlesaspossi- ble agreements and associate “worst payoﬀs,” instead of “payoﬀs,” with these agreements. What are the “rationality” properties of virtual bar- gaining? Virtual bargaining diﬀers from the “ratio- nality” assumptions underpinning the Nash equilib- rium in the following ways. First, virtual bargains may involve strictly dominated strategies in terms of pay- oﬀs (but not in terms of “worst payoﬀs”). According to somestrictconceptionsofrationality(especiallypreva- lent in standard game theory), choosing any domi- nated option must necessarily be irrational. However, examples of strategic interactions (e.g., the Traveler’s Dilemma, the Centipede Game, and Newcomb’s Prob- lem) have been taken, by some, to imply that this crite- rion of rationality has some paradoxical consequences. Be that as it may, many theorists may view virtual bar- gaining as departing from strict rationality on these grounds. Second, as in, for example, level-k reasoning, vir- tual bargaining involves inconsistent beliefs to some degree. On the one hand, each player considers two possibilities for each strategy proﬁle: the other player will either stick to the bargain or best respond to it. On the other hand, each player knows for certain whethertheythemselveswillfollowthebargainorbest respond. As discussed above, this “inconsistency”— or “asymmetry”—is similar to that in real bargaining. This is a diﬀerent type of inconsistency than in level-k reasoning, where each player assumes that their coun- terpart uses a lower level of reasoning than they do themselves. When making their choices, the two players simu- late a bargaining process that, given the players’ sta- tus quo positions, chooses one of the feasible agree- ments. The status quo position for each player in the bargaining process is given by her worst payoﬀ from a feasible agreement that is worst for him. For- mally, playeri’s fallback position is deﬁned aswm i /equalx min(σF 1 ,σF 2 )∈F wi(σF 1 ,σF 2 ). In what follows, we will callwm i the minimum feasible worst payoﬀ of playeri. Note thatforcertaingames—forexample,intheBattleofthe Sexes game—(σF 1 ,σF 2 )∈F such that (wm 1 ,wm 2 )/equalx ( w1(σF 1 ,σF 2 ),w2(σF 1 ,σF 2 ) ) . That is, the minimum feasible worst payoﬀs of the twoplayersmaycorrespondtodiﬀerentfeasibleagree- ments. If the game has a unique feasible agreement, thenbothplayersreceivetheirminimumfeasibleworst payoﬀsfromplayingtheuniquefeasibleagreement.In this case, the latter characterizes the status quo posi- tions of both players. The bargaining mechanism used to choose a virtual bargain is the Nash bargaining solution6 where the players’statusquopositionsaretheirminimumfeasible Melkonyan, Zeitoun, and Chater:Collusion in Bertrand vs. Cournot Competition 5604 Management Science, 2018, vol. 64, no. 12, pp. 5599–5609,©2017 The Author(s) worst payoﬀs. Formally, avirtual bargaining equilibrium (VBE) (σV 1 ,σV 2 )is a feasible agreement that maximizes the product of diﬀerences between the players’ worst payoﬀs under this strategy pair and the worst pay- oﬀs from the status quo subject to the constraint that bothplayers’payoﬀsexceedtheirrespectivestatusquo payoﬀs: (σV 1 ,σV 2 )∈arg max (σF 1 ,σF 2 )∈F 2∏ i/equalx1 (wi(σF i ,σF −i)−wm i ). (4) Notealsothat,forsimplicity,wehaveassumedthatthe two players have equal bargaining powers. Our deﬁni- tion of the virtual bargaining equilibrium can be read- ily extended to the general case of arbitrary bargain- ing powers. Although the analysis is straightforward for the general case, for the purposes of compact nota- tion, we maintain the assumption of equal bargaining powers throughout the paper. It follows immediately from the deﬁnition of the virtual bargaining equilib- rium that under standard regularity conditions on the sets Σi and the payoﬀ functionsui(·,·), the game has a virtual bargaining equilibrium. By the deﬁnition of the Nash bargaining solution, any virtual bargaining equilibrium will be Pareto-optimal (with respect to the players’ worst payoﬀs) among the set of feasible agree- ments. Moreover, any virtual bargaining equilibrium is Pareto-undominated by any Nash equilibrium. At the same time, a game may have a strategy proﬁle that is not feasible and whose payoﬀ vector Pareto- dominates (with respect to the players’ payoﬀs) all fea- sible agreements. The Prisoners’ Dilemma is an exam- ple of such a game. Thus, our equilibrium notion is diﬀerent from both Nash equilibrium and Pareto crite- rion (with respect to the players’ payoﬀs). Returning to the example of Table 1, note that the worst payoﬀ of 34 from the feasible agreement ((H,6 7 ; N,1 7 ),(H,6 7 ; N,1 7 ))exceedstheminimumfeasible payoﬀofzero.Itthenfollowsimmediatelyfrom(4)that ((H,6 7 ; N,1 7 ),(H,6 7 ; N,1 7 ))is the unique virtual bargain- ing equilibrium.7 If both players follow through with this agreement, then they can signiﬁcantly improve theirpayoﬀscomparedtotheNashpayoﬀofzero. We now analyze Cournot and Bertrand competition inturnusingvirtualbargaining.Theanalysisprovides a possible explanation why collusion arises so much more readily in the latter competitive environment. 3. Cournot Competition Consider the following Cournot game with two ﬁrms, i /equalx1,2,eachproducingoutput qi ∈R+.Weassumethat the ﬁrms have constant marginal costs.8 Without any further loss of generality, these marginal costs are set equal to zero. The inverse demand functions for the two ﬁrms’ products are given by p1 /equalxα−βq1 −γq2 and p2 /equalxα−βq2 −γq1, where α>β ≥γ> 0. Thus, the goods produced by the two ﬁrms are substitutes and each ﬁrmi’s proﬁt func- tionis πi(qi ,q−i)/equalx(α−βqi −γq−i)qi.Theoutputchoices aremadebythetwoﬁrmssimultaneouslyandindepen- dently. Since∂2πi/∂q1∂q2 /equalx−γ< 0, the ﬁrms’ outputs arestrategicsubstitutes(Bulowetal.1985,Topkis1998). Firm i’s best response to output q−i is given by Ri(q−i)/equalx(α−γq−i)/(2β). The unique Nash equilibrium is given byqN 1 /equalxqN 2 /equalxα/(2β+ γ). The output combina- tion that maximizes the joint of the two ﬁrms’ proﬁts is given byq∗ 1 /equalxq∗ 2 /equalxα/(2β+ 2γ). We will refer to the latter output combination as the collusive outcome. The worst payoﬀ of an agreement(q1,q2)for ﬁrm i /equalx1,2 is given by wi(qi ,q−i) /equalxmin { πi(qi ,q−i), sup q′ −i ∈R−i (qi ) πi(qi ,q′ −i) } /equalxmin { πi(qi ,q−i),πi(qi ,R−i(qi)) } /equalx    (α−βqi −γq−i)qi , if qi >α−2βq−i γ ; ((2β−γ)α−(2β2 −γ2)qi)qi 2β , if qi ≤α−2βq−i γ .

Conversely, when the weighted average is small, playeri’s worst payoﬀ is equal to proﬁt for the scenario where the opponent best responds. This property of the worst payoﬀ func- tion is intuitive. An agreement is relatively attractive when the market is not saturated. In this case, a best- responsebyanopponentwillhaveadetrimentaleﬀect on a player relative to the payoﬀ from the agreement. Conversely, when the market is saturated, the agree- ment itself is relatively unattractive and an opponent’s best response to the agreement has a positive impact on a player.

Theset F isgivenbytheunionofthelinesegments EN and ND in Figure 1, which correspond to the ﬁrst and second elements of the above union. Using (4), we obtain that the unique virtual bargain- ing equilibrium coincides with the Nash equilibrium (point N in Figure 1).9 We summarize our ﬁndings in the following: Proposition 1. The unique VB equilibrium of the Cournot game coincides with the NE. The intuition why the VB collapses to Nash is as follows. Suppose that the players consider reducing their outputs below the Nash level. Because of strate- gic substitutability between the players’ choices, each player realizes that if she decreases her output and the opponent foresees the reduction, the latter player will compensate for the reduction by increasing her own output; and the more a player decreases her own output, the more the opponent will compensate by increasing her output. Hence, the worst payoﬀ associ- ated with smaller outputs will be determined by the scenario where the opponent increases her output by bestresponding.This,however,isarelativelyunattrac- tive scenario since the decrease in output is met by a noncollusive output increase by the opponent. For- mally, an agreement with outputs that are lower than the Nash level for both players is not feasible. As a result, the VB equilibrium coincides with the NE. 4. Bertrand Competition Virtual bargaining and Nash behavior are diﬀerent when ﬁrms compete in prices. Consider the following Bertrand game with linear demand functions. There are two ﬁrms,i /equalx1,2, in the market each producing output qi ∈R+ and selling its output at pricepi ∈R+. As in Cournot competition, the ﬁrms have constant marginal costs that are normalized to zero. The direct demand functions for the two ﬁrms’ products are given by q1 /equalxa −bp1 + cp2 and q2 /equalxa −bp2 + cp1, where b ≥c >0. Thus, the goods sold by the two ﬁrms are substitutes. Each ﬁrm i’s proﬁt function can be written asπi(pi ,p−i)/equalx(a −bpi + cp−i)pi. The prices are chosen by the two ﬁrms simultaneously and indepen- dently. Since∂2πi/∂p1∂p2 /equalxc >0, the prices of the two ﬁrms are strategic complements. Firm i’s best response to price p−i is given by Ri(p−i)/equalx(a + cp−i)/(2b). The unique Nash equilibrium is given bypN ≡pN 1 /equalxpN 2 /equalxa/(2b −c). The Nash equi- librium output is given byqN ≡qN 1 /equalxqN 2 /equalxab/(2b −c). The price combination that maximizes the total of the two ﬁrms’ proﬁts is given byp∗ ≡p∗ 1 /equalxp∗ 2 /equalx a/(2b −2c). It is straightforward to verify that the joint proﬁt-maximizing price pC exceeds the Nash equilib- rium pricepN . The corresponding output levels have the reverse relationship:q∗/equalxa/2 <qN . As in the previ- ous section, we refer to this outcome as collusive. The worst payoﬀ of an agreement(p1,p2)for ﬁrm i /equalx1,2 is given by wi(p1,p2)/equalxmin { πi(pi ,p−i), sup p′ −i ∈R−i (pi ) πi(pi ,p′ −i) } /equalxmin{πi(p1,p2),πi(pi ,R−i(pi))} /equalx    (a −bpi + cp−i)pi , if pi >2bp−i −a c ; ( a −bpi + c(a + cpi) 2b ) pi , if pi ≤2bp−i −a c .

Inthiscase,theopponent’sbestresponseisapricethat is large relative to the agreement’s prescription. This, in turn, results in a proﬁt that is larger than the proﬁt πi(p1,p2)under the agreement. Conversely, when a player’spriceisrelativelysmallcomparedtotheoppo- nent’s price, the player’s worst payoﬀ is equal to her proﬁt for the case where the opponent best responds. We demonstrate in the appendix that the best- response function of playeri for the worst payoﬀ func- tion wi(p1,p2)is given by RF i (p−i)/equalx    a + cp−i 2b , if p−i ≤ a (2b −c); 2bp−i −a c , if a (2b −c)<p−i < a(4b2 −c2 +2bc) 4b(2b2 −c2) ; a(2b + c) 2(2b2 −c2), if p−i ≥a(4b2 −c2 +2bc) 4b(2b2 −c2) .

From the deﬁnition of a feasible agreement, an agreement (pF 1 ,pF 2 )is feasible if and only ifpF i ∈RF i (pF −i) for i /equalx1,2. It follows immediately from this charac- terization of feasible agreements and (7) that the only Figure 2.

(9) Using(4),weobtainthattheuniquevirtualbargaining equilibrium is given by(pV 1 ,pV 2 ). We summarize our ﬁndings in the following: Proposition 2.

(b) The joint proﬁts under the VB equilibrium in the Bertrandgamearestrictlygreaterthanthejointproﬁtsofthe two ﬁrms under the NE but strictly smaller than the joint proﬁts under the collusive outcome. This result is in stark contrast with the ﬁnding for Cournot competition where virtual bargaining leads tothenoncollusiveNashequilibriumoutcome.Virtual bargaining allows the two players to partially collude by raising the price above the Nash level. To see the intuition behind this ﬁnding, suppose that the play- ers consider moving toward a collusive scenario and increasing the prices above the Nash level. Because of strategic complementarity, each player realizes that an increase in price will be met by a higher price of her opponent. Hence, the worst payoﬀ associated with higher prices will be determined by the scenario where the players follow the agreement to increase their prices. Since this is a relatively attractive option, the players will favor a collusive price increase. Both the VB and the collusive prices decrease with increases inb and decreases inc, and the latter price exhibitsgreaterreductions.Thus,theVBpriceiscloser to the collusive price (the ratio of the two prices pV /p∗/equalx1 −bc/(2b2 −c2)is large) when the slope of the direct demand curve is large with respect to own price(large b)andsmallwithrespecttothepriceofthe competitor (smallc). Similarly, both the NE and VB prices decrease with increases in b and decreases inc and the latter price exhibitsgreaterreductions.Thus,theNEpriceiscloser to the VB price (the ratio of the two pricespN /pV /equalx 1 −c2/(4b2 −c2)is large) when the slope of the direct demand curve is large with respect to own price (largeb)andsmallwithrespecttothepriceofthecom- petitor (smallc).

Comparison with Alternative Accounts It is illuminating to contrast the concept of virtual bar- gainingwithalternativenon-Nashaccountsofstrategic behavior, such as the cognitive hierarchy and level-k models (e.g., Camerer et al. 2004, Nagel 1995, Stahl and Wilson 1994) and quantal response equilibrium (QRE) (e.g., Goeree et al. 2002, 2003; McKelvey and Palfrey1995).Themostcrucialdiﬀerenceisthatvirtual bargaining oﬀers a cognitive account of actors being guided by “unspoken agreements” (e.g., Carlin et al. 2007, Jones 1921). Thus, virtual bargaining makes a distinctive contribution in explaining the underlying cognitive mechanism and ensuing behavior. A second important diﬀerence is that the standard versions of level-k reasoning and QRE rely on players choosingfromamongdiscretealternatives.Virtualbar- gaining,incontrast,enablestheplayerstomakecontin- uous choices. In the real world, we can think of quan- tities,prices,andeﬀortlevelsasquasi-continuousmea- sures. Equally importantly, if we model such measures as discrete, then the choice of discretization can gen- erate artifacts in some theories. For example, a level-k reasoner might draw back from complete collusion bykiterations—butwhetherthiscorrespondstokcents or k dollars fewer than the completely collusive solu- tiondependsontheprecisionwithwhichamountsare deﬁned. In addition to these two crucial diﬀerences, it is unclearwhatlevel-ktheoryandQREwouldpredictfor the competitive settings considered in our paper. We arenotawareofanypublishedpapersthatapplythese two theories to Cournot and Bertrand competition. In the case of level-k reasoning, the predictions would be highlysensitivetothestartingpoint(i.e.,totheassump- tion made about level-0). If players face a ﬁne-grained grid of choices (in terms of quantities and prices), the level-k prediction will be very close to level-0, because most players do not make more than three iterative stepsofreasoning(e.g.,AradandRubinstein2012). In the case of QRE, we can view QRE as a “generali- zation of the Nash equilibrium, and it converges to a Nashoutcomeas[the‘error’parameter] µgoestozero (perfect rationality)” (Goeree et al. 2003, p. 101). QRE’s deviation from Nash equilibria crucially depends on the parameterµ, and the predictions for Cournot and Bertrand competition would be highly sensitive to the assumption about this parameter. Beyond determin- ingµ,wewouldalsoneedconceptualargumentstoclar- ify whether µ is a universal parameter, or whether it shoulddiﬀerforCournotversusBertrandsettings. A notion related to virtual bargaining equilibrium is that of maximin equilibrium introduced by Ismail (2014a, b). He proposes a model of equilibrium behav- ior where the worst-case payoﬀ from a strategy proﬁle is deﬁned as the minimum payoﬀ the player receives (i) from that proﬁle or (ii) when the opponent better- responds. According to his procedure, the game is transformed into another game in which the origi- nal payoﬀs are replaced with the worst-case payoﬀs. Accordingly,anagreementiscalledamaximinequilib- riumifitsworst-casepayoﬀsarePareto-optimal(Ismail 2014b), or it is a Nash equilibrium of the transformed game(Ismail2014a).Notethatvirtualbargainingequi- librium chooses an agreement that must be a speciﬁc Pareto-optimal Nash equilibrium in the transformed game corresponding to the feasible payoﬀs, whereas maximin equilibrium chooses all Pareto-optimal pro- ﬁlesoralltheNashequilibriainthetransformedgame corresponding to the procedure in Ismail (2014a, b). In sum, we can conclude that virtual bargaining makesadistinctivecontributioninexplainingandpre- dicting collusion in Cournot and Bertrand settings. And these two settings are, of course, foundational for understanding competitive behavior. This discus- sion should not imply that we want to discard level-k reasoning and QRE as models of strategic behavior. Both approaches have generated a great many use- ful insights. Moreover, these models have signiﬁcant explanatory power in many strategic situations. We leave to future research the interesting research ques- tion of comparing, both theoretically and empirically, level-k reasoning and QRE with reasoning based on virtual bargaining. 6. Conclusion This paper oﬀers a novel account of collusive behavior that distinguishes between outcomes in Bertrand and Cournot competition. Virtual bargaining contains ele- ments of both noncooperative and cooperative reason- ing. It sustains collusive outcomes without third-party enforcement. Collusion can be a result of virtual bar- gaining as a mode of reasoning, thereby requiring nei- thercommunicationnordynamicconsiderations,such asrewardsandpunishments,betweentheplayers.The model provides insights into why collusion in price competition can be sustained without communication and why it is hard to detect.

To determine this best-response correspondence, consider the properties of wi(qi ,q−i)as a function of qi. Using (5), we obtain the following. Whenq−i ≥α/(2β+ γ), wi(qi ,q−i), as a function ofqi, increases on the interval[0,(α−2βq−i)/γ), has a kink at (α−2βq−i)/γ, continues to increase on the interval [(α−2βq−i)/γ, (α−γq−i)/(2β)), achieves its unique maximum at (α−γq−i)/(2β), and decreases for the values of qi exceeding (α−γq−i)/(2β). Whenα/(2β)−(α(2β−γ)γ)/ (4β(2β2 −γ2))<q−i <α/(2β+ γ), wi(qi ,q−i)increases on the interval [0,(α−2βq−i)/γ), has a kink and a unique max- imum at (α−2βq−i)/γ, and decreases for the values ofqi exceeding (α−2βq−i)/γ. When q−i ≤α/(2β)−( α(2β−γ)γ)/ (4β(2β2 −γ2)), wi(qi ,q−i) increases on the interval [0, (2β−γ)α/(2(2β2 −γ2))), achieves its unique maximum at (2β−γ)α/(2(2β2 −γ2)), decreases on the interval((2β−γ)α/ (2(2β2 −γ2)), (α−2βq−i)/γ), has a kink at (α−2βq−i)/γ, and continues to decrease for the values of qi exceeding (α−2βq−i)/γ. Thus, wi(qi ,q−i)is single peaked as a function ofqi for all threepossiblerangesof q−i spelledoutintheprecedingpara- graph.Theuniquepeakineachofthesecasescorrespondsto the best-response function in expression (6). Derivation of (8) Considerthepropertiesof wi(p1,p2)asafunctionof pi.When p−i <a/(2b −c),wi(pi ,p−i),asafunctionof pi,increasesonthe interval[0,(2bp−i −a)/c),hasakinkat (2bp−i −a)/c,increases on the interval [(2bp−i −a)/c, (a + cp−i)/(2b)), achieves its unique maximum at (a + cp−i)/(2b), and decreases for the values of pi exceeding (a + cp−i)/(2b). When a/(2b −c)< p−i < a(4b2 −c2 + 2bc)/(4b(2b2 −c2)), wi(pi ,p−i) increases on the interval [0,(2bp−i −a)/c), has a kink and a unique maximum at (2bp−i −a)/c, and decreases for the values of pi exceeding (2bp−i −a)/c. When p−i >a(4b2 −c2 +2bc)/ (4b(2b2 −c2)),wi(pi ,p−i)increasesontheinterval [0,a(2b + c)/ (2(2b2 −c2))), achieves its unique maximum at a(2b + c)/ (2(2b2 −c2)),decreasesontheinterval (a(2b + c)/(2(2b2 −c2)), (2bp−i −a)/c), has a kink at(2bp−i −a)/c, and continues to decreaseforthevaluesof qi exceeding(2bp−i −a)/c. Note that wi(p1,p2)is single peaked as a function ofpi in all three cases characterized in the preceding paragraph. The unique peak in each of these cases corresponds to the best-response function in expression (8). Endnotes 1We refer to the opponent as “she.” 2In the matching pennies game, and in constant-sum games more generally, by playing a mixed strategy, a player minimizes the opponent’s ability to distinguish and exploit systematic patterns of behavior. 3Wedeﬁnethenotionofavirtualbargainingequilibriumfornormal form games with arbitrary number of players elsewhere. 4We are indebted to the department editor for suggesting this inter- pretation of the worst payoﬀs. 5It is straightforward to verify that, similarly to Bertrand competi- tion, the game of Table 1 is supermodular (Milgrom and Shannon 1994, Topkis 1998). 6One could allow for alternative bargaining mechanisms to arrive at the virtual bargain. 7This holds for any distribution of bargaining powers among the players. 8Our assumptions of constant marginal costs and linear demands are made to save on notation and to facilitate illustration of the virtual bargaining equilibrium. Our main ﬁndings hold for a gen- eral Cournot model with standard assumptions on the demand and cost functions. The same comment applies to the model of Bertrand competition. 9Note that if we relaxed the assumption of equal bargaining power betweentheplayers,thentheVBequilibriumcouldbeanagreement in the setF that was diﬀerent from the Nash equilibrium.
