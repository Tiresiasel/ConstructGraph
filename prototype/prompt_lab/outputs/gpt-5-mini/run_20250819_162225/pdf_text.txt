We develop a multiphase model which, from a multilevel perspective addressing different relational subsets, suggests how ﬁrms can best organize to generate and exchange knowledge efﬁciently. We argue that extant theoretical perspectives can proﬁtably draw on our ﬁndings to strengthen their dynamic components and help them explain the widely diffused ‘exploring through partner’ strategies more effectively.

INTRODUCTION Both executives and academics have recently iden- tiﬁed knowledge as one of the most important factors contributing to ﬁrms’ ability to achieve sus- tainable competitive advantage (Dyer and Singh, 1998; Dyer and Nobeoka, 2000; Zhao, Anand, and Mitchell, 2005). At the same time, a growing body of research has come to consider networks as an appropriate unit of analysis (Powell, Koput, and Smith-Doerr, 1996; Kogut, 2000) and to exam- ine the question of where a ﬁrm should draw its boundaries (Parmigiani and Mitchell, 2009) on the understanding that ‘where boundaries are Keywords: knowledge exchange and creation; interﬁrm networks; core and peripheral ﬁrms; knowledge-enhanc- ing practices; motorcycle industry *Correspondence to: Andrea Lipparini, Department of Manage- ment, University of Bologna, Via Capo di Lucca, 34 – Bologna, Italy.

This work has shown how knowl- edge and other critical resources increasingly span ﬁrm boundaries so that the advantage of a sin- gle ﬁrm is often linked to those of the network of ties in which it is embedded (Dyer and Singh, 1998). In particular, research rooted in innova- tion literature (Powell et al., 1996; Zhao et al., 2005) and in buyer–supplier relationships (Kotabe, Martin, and Domoto, 2003) has emphasized the increasing importance of networking, alliances and idiosyncratic interﬁrm relations (Martin, Mitchell, and Swaminathan, 1995), and the advantages of adopting a cooperative mode for knowledge cre- ation (Mesquita, Anand, and Brush, 2008). Strate- gic literature’s focus on knowledge creation and management has been expanding in unprecedented fashion, so that the key knowledge-based ques- tions companies face are not only how to organize themselves to exploit their already developed © 2013 The Authors.StrategicManagementJournal published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Research Notes and Commentaries 579 knowledge or capabilities, but also ‘how to orga- nize to efﬁciently generate knowledge and capa- bility’ (Nickerson and Zenger, 2004: 617). Our multiple case, inductive study (Eisenhardt, 1989) attempts to answer the above question. We present a multiphase model of interﬁrm knowledge creation and exchange across dyads and networks and discuss the important (per- haps even dominant) role that buying ﬁrms play in the evolution of networks and of inter- ﬁrm learning processes, which has hitherto been underexplored in the strategic literature. We posit that networks become viable organizational forms for sharing and generating valuable knowl- edge when a set of purposefully implemented knowledge-enhancing practices—which we deﬁne as distinctive patterns of action and interaction between core ﬁrms—‘buyers’—and peripheral ﬁrms—‘suppliers’—that enable the exchange, recombination, and co-creation of specialized knowledge—allow ﬁrms to leverage knowledge located beyond their organizational boundaries. 1 In particular, we focus on a total of 892 projects asso- ciated with the design and/or manufacture of com- ponents for motorbikes and/or scooters in the Ital- ian two-wheeler industry. These projects involved 17 leading motorcycle manufacturers—core buyer ﬁrms who were responsible for setting up and subsequently ‘orchestrating’ dyads and networks (Dhanaraj and Parkhe, 2006)—and their (periph- eral) ﬁrst-tier suppliers. CONCEPTUAL BACKGROUND Although prominent ﬁrm perspectives have con- tributed greatly to explain how ﬁrms achieve sus- tainable competitive advantage, they still overlook the fact that, increasingly, even unique resources span ﬁrm boundaries and can be selectively trad- able through a network of ﬁrms (Kogut and Zan- der, 1992; Gulati, 1999). Even contributions that have signiﬁcantly extended resource-based reason- ing (Barney, 1991; Peteraf, 1993) and are rooted in knowledge and capability-based views in strategy (Kogut and Zander 1992; Conner and Prahalad, 1 Throughout the article, we make use of the core periphery pattern to convey the particular situation in which core ﬁrms, which possess prominence gained through relational skills and their central position in network structures, leverage their position to harness the knowledge dispersed among peripheral ﬁrms. 1996; Teece, Pisano, and Shuen, 1997; Felin and Hesterly, 2007) share a main focus on intraﬁrm transfers of existing knowledge (Hansen 1999; Tsai 2001; Reagans and McEvily, 2003; Levin and Cross, 2004) and are less well equipped to analyze knowledge transfer and creation across fully inde- pendent entities (which have become signiﬁcantly more common over a wide range of industries, from automobiles to semiconductors) (Nickerson and Zenger, 2004; Hansen, Mors, and Løv ˚as, 2005; Mesquita et al., 2008). A growing number of empirical studies rooted in innovation literature (Powell et al., 1996; Zhao et al., 2005), and espe- cially those adopting a relational perspective (Dyer and Singh, 1998), explicitly consider the collabo- rative network, rather than the single ﬁrm, as the locus for learning and innovation. In particular, research on buyer–supplier networks in the auto- mobile industry (Dyer, 1996; Osborn and Hage- doorn, 1997; Argote et al., 2003) has shown how the extensive involvement of suppliers in product and process development has given lead assem- blers faster product development cycles, lower costs, better end product quality (Womack, Jones, and Roos, 1990; Dyer and Nobeoka, 2000), and faster problem solving (Takeishi, 2001). The idea that networks are critical for knowledge creation and exchange is corroborated by studies conducted from knowledge transfer perspectives (Tsai, 2001; Reagans and McEvily, 2003; Inkpen and Tsang, 2005). Systematic evidence from this research stream indicates that networks with substantial knowledge transfer mechanisms between man- ufacturers and suppliers out-innovate relational sets with less well-developed knowledge-sharing routines. Following Kogut (2000), we see networks as the outcomes of generative rules of knowledge coordi- nation, which constitute capabilities (e.g., speedy response to change, resource orchestration, etc.) generating relational rents, which can be subject to private appropriation. Our study focuses on mul- tiple transactions and on those deliberate and pur- poseful actions designed to facilitate knowledge generation and mobility across networks’ bound- aries, which are central to their ability to co- innovate and so co-create value (Zhaoet al., 2005). While most studies focus on ties with generically deﬁned content, we disentangle the intertempo- ral processes of knowledge creation and exchange between organizations and adopt a multilevel per- spective that addresses three different subsets Strat.

Lipparini, G. Lorenzoni, and S. Ferriani of relationships—R&D, operations, and other up- and downstream activities. We also investigate learning processes and knowledge-related activi- ties involving both sides of the dyad and consider them as both knowledge transmitters and recipi- ents. Although several studies have included bilat- eral (buyer and supplier) analyses (e.g., Zander and Kogut, 1995; Takeishi, 2001; Kotabe et al., 2003), they have considered knowledge ﬂows only as unidirectional—one unit providing and one receiving—and such perspectives clearly limit our understanding of cases where ﬁrms both provide and receive knowledge. Finally, we show how the effective creation and extraction of network value hinges on the purposeful enactment by core ﬁrms of practices designed to lead and facilitate knowl- edge sharing and deployment. METHODS Research design, setting, and sample construction Our inductive, multiple case study (Eisenhardt, 1989) examines the Italian powered two-wheeler industry, which we deemed appropriate for sev- eral reasons. First, product architecture: motorcy- cles and scooters 2 are made of dozens of mod- ules and subassemblies whose development and manufacture requires diverse and speciﬁc know- how and expertise (Helfat, Lipparini, and Verona, 2011). Second, the level of product innovation involved is appropriate: manufacturers are con- tinually challenged by the introduction of new materials—plastics, titanium, carbon ﬁbers, light alloys, etc.—into frames and components, as well as the need to meet changing environ- mental regulations (Helfat et al., 2011). Third, the intense industrial process innovations, which require manufacturers to adopt state-of-the-art equipment and R&D practices and to base their manufacturing activities on leading-edge technolo- gies (Gavetti, 2001). Fourth, the size of Italy’s domestic market—the largest in Europe in terms of powered two-wheeler production (nearly 55%), registrations (26.7%), and numbers of motorcy- cles in use (26%)—and its competitive position as 2 A scooter is a small-engined, two-wheeled motor vehicle with certain design characteristics such as a step-through frame, small wheels, and an automatic transmission. Europe’s leading exporter, headed only by Japan and Taiwan in world rankings (ACEM - Associa- tion des Constructeurs Europ ´eens de Motocycles, 2010). Our study included core motorcycle ﬁrms (assemblers) that sold products in Italy (regard- less of their country of origin) and peripheral ﬁrms (suppliers) localized in Italy that special- ized in the design and/or manufacture of industry components. Both of these types of ﬁrms work within a network structure of non-equity, long- term cooperative buyer/supplier relationships. We selected core ﬁrms on the basis of lists sup- plied by the Italian Ministry of Transportation (from www.trasporti.gov.it) and the trade associa- tion (www.ancma.it), and we used Italian market sales performance ﬁgures for 2007, the most recent year for which comprehensive statistics were avail- able. We contacted representatives at the full list of 25 core ﬁrms specializing in scooter and/or motor- cycle design and/or production, and 17—covering nearly 85 percent of Italian market sales—agreed to participate. In selecting peripheral ﬁrms, we ﬁrst used business publications to identify relevant groups of two-wheeler components and modules, each including multiple, often specialized, sub- components (thus, ‘body’ includes frame, suspen- sion, forks, etc.; ‘brakes’ include drums, cylinders, pads, shoes, etc.). Working from publicly avail- able sources (e.g., motorcycle and spare parts cata- logs, national and international exhibition business directories, online bikers’ communities, etc.), we identiﬁed a list of 43 component suppliers. Check- ing this list with our full core ﬁrm group, we identiﬁed 19 suppliers who each had links with at least seven core ﬁrms: 13 of them agreed to participate and supplied details about their ties to core ﬁrms. Data collection and analyses To avoid restrictive theoretical or empirical lenses (Santos and Eisenhardt, 2005), we deﬁned knowledge broadly, as encompassing both easily codiﬁable and transmittable information and com- plex and more difﬁcult to codify know-how. The interaction patterns we noted implied the existence of ties between two entities, which we deﬁne as voluntary collaborative arrangements of strategic signiﬁcance between independent organizations, based on written contracts and aimed at sharing tacit and explicit knowledge .

In particular, we conducted 81 face-to-face on-site interviews (totaling nearly 170 hours) over a 28-month period in 2007, 2008, and 2010 with 52 different executives from both core and peripheral ﬁrms. Respondents were selected according to several criteria (Yin, 1994): long tenure in the company; direct involvement in knowledge-related decisions; and functional and hierarchical variety. This use of multiple internal sources helped mitigate the potential biases of any individual respondent (Kumar, Stern, and Anderson, 1993). 3 We began our interviews at the core ﬁrms. Each consisted of three main parts: background information on the ﬁrm and its business strategy; description of key events in the formation and evolution of the ﬁrm’s ties (if any) with our sample suppliers; and direct questions about knowledge exchange/creation, including details of develop- ment projects for new scooter/motorcycle com- ponents core ﬁrms had with each listed supplier. The ﬁrst interview round (2007 to 2008) focused on projects from 2004 to 2007, and the second round (2010) focused on 2008 to 2009 projects. We queried the types of knowledge exchanged with each supplier and the main direction of knowl- edge ﬂows, which might be simple—mostly out- bound ﬂows of information and know-how toward suppliers or return ﬂows to core ﬁrms—or more advanced—bidirectional and intertwined interac- tions that might contribute to the cogeneration of knowledge. Lastly, we asked core ﬁrms about the practices they had implemented to support such knowledge ﬂows and any that facilitated ﬂows between their suppliers. We used interview tech- niques such as ‘event tracking’ to gain accurate information (Eisenhardt, 1989) and repeated the process later with peripheral ﬁrms. We triangulated our interview data with observation and archival data to improve its accuracy and completeness, combining contemporary and retrospective data 3 The composition of our sample ﬁrms, their product ranges, and the position of each company’s interviewees is available online See Appendix S1. to improve both external and internal validity (Leonard-Barton, 1990). We selected key peripheral ﬁrm informants on the same criteria as for core ﬁrms and followed the same basic interview structure so that the responses complemented our core ﬁrm data. We asked supplier executives to report about the spe- ciﬁc projects identiﬁed by the core ﬁrms—about the levels of relevant information and know-how they had received from their buyers, the knowl- edge they had returned to them embedded in components or services, and about bidirectional ﬂows and joint knowledge creation. They also reported on knowledge ﬂows between them and other peripheral ﬁrms promoted by a common core ﬁrm. In all, we collected data on 892 projects enacted via 184 dyads connecting 17 core ﬁrms and 13 peripheral ﬁrms: more speciﬁcally, on 776 projects carried out via 163 buyer–supplier ties and 116 stemming from 21 supplier-supplier relationships. All these collaborations (58 of which involved racing) were based on written contracts and (as our interview analysis revealed) could be categorized into one of three broad func- tional areas: R&D, operations, and other up- and downstream activities, which we identiﬁed as the industry’s focal organizational areas for knowledge exchange and creation. Figure 1 highlights the whole pattern of ties between core and peripheral ﬁrms (solid lines), as well as between peripheral ﬁrms (dotted lines). Table 1 highlights the main activities carried out by the core ﬁrms and the components/groups supplied by peripheral ﬁrms. Our data analyses were structured according to established procedures for theory building from inductive research, working recursively between multiple cases and theory (Eisenhardt, 1989; Yin, 1994). We included all the interviews and archival and observational data in a report of approximately 550 pages (including quotes), beginning with in-depth analyses, synthesizing the data for each project and dyad into individual case histories, and noting knowledge ﬂows, their dominant directions, and the practices underlying them. We then moved to cross-case analyses, which produced consistent patterns and common themes (Eisenhardt and Graebner, 2007): initially we compared varied pairs of cases (e.g., speciﬁc knowledge transfer occurrences seen from the core and peripheral ﬁrms’ perspectives) and added other interﬁrm knowledge-enhancing practices as patterns emerge to identify more robust Strat.

We structured our analysis of knowledge- enhancing practices using a ‘temporal bracketing’ strategy (Langley, 1999), organizing the data into successive ‘phases,’ deﬁned so that there is con- tinuity in the activities within each phase but dis- continuities at their frontiers (Langley and Truax, 1994). As Langley (1999: 703) notes, ‘many tem- poral processes can be decomposed in this way, at least partly, without presuming any progressive developmental logic.’ Our data analysis allowed us to develop a four-phase conceptual model of how core ﬁrms deliberately shaped knowledge prac- tices to stimulate interﬁrm knowledge exchange and creation, at both the dyad and network levels. Our ﬁrm informants helped us identify and validate the four phases and the knowledge ﬂows involved. THE SHAPING OF KNOWLEDGE EXCHANGE AND CREATION IN DYADS AND NETWORK: A FOUR-PHASE MODEL The interﬁrm exchange and co-creation of knowl- edge in the Italian motorcycle industry network we investigated can be portrayed in four phases. In Phase 1, knowledge ﬂows are mainly from core to peripheral ﬁrm, the former channeling information and know-how to a number of selected suppliers. In Phase 2, knowledge ﬂows reverse this direc- tion, moving mainly to core ﬁrms from peripherals, who return some of the knowledge they origi- nally received in more reﬁned forms and transfers some of their own proprietary knowledge to the core ﬁrms. Once knowledge transfer channels have been established, Phase 3 sees bidirectional ﬂows, Strat. Mgmt.

In Phase 4, knowledge ﬂows between peripheral ﬁrms that are linked to the same core ﬁrm, and learning extends from dyads to the network. These phases do not represent ‘stages’ in the sense of being a predictable and sequential process and do not imply a progressive life cycle logic as found in many normative change theories. Speciﬁ- cally, they allow us to constitute comparative units of analysis to explore theoretical ideas (Langley, 1999)—and are especially useful in illustrating how the actions in one period affect those under- taken in the next. Figure 2 illustrates the temporal structuring of the different phases, showing how an example core ﬁrm (Honda Italia) maintains a port- folio of ties with different peripheral ﬁrms. Each core ﬁrm will have such a portfolio of ongoing projects with each supplier, which may be at differ- ent phases and may relate to R&D, operations, or upstream/downstream activities alone, or to them all. This example case shows Honda’s portfolio of eight projects (related to the many versions of its scooters and bikes) in which it collaborates with P12 (a steel alloy body supplier) and their different learning phases. Thus, Project A (the heavyweight CBR1000RR bike entirely designed and manufac- tured in Italy) entered Phase 1 in Q1, 2003 and Phase 2 in Q2, 2004, and has been in Phase 3 since Q2, 2006. Project B (developing and manu- facturing frames for top-selling scooters, e.g., the SH300) spent more than two years in Phase 1, had been through Phase 2 (with inbound ﬂows overlap- ping the Phase 1 outbound ﬂows by a considerable margin), and entered Phase 3 in Q1, 2009. At the time of the survey, it was expected to enter Phase 4 in Q2, 2012, as the peripheral ﬁrm P12 starts collaborations with two other suppliers to develop a frame for next-generation scooters. Project C (developing steel alloy frame for scooters like the Foresight 250) has been in Phase 1 since Q1, 2003: Honda Japan had already developed deﬁni- tive engineering details, and suppliers were invited to exploit Honda’s innovation to add value for both partners. But Phase 4-type information and know-how ﬂows have been taking place between the frame maker and partners supplying braking systems and wheels (three highly interdependent components) since Q2, 2008. At the time of the survey, Project C was expected to enter Phase 2 in Q3, 2012, with inbound knowledge ﬂows from P12 constituting the platform for Honda engineers’ future design activities. Phase 1—Knowledge ﬂows from core ﬁrms to peripheral ﬁrms Core ﬁrms are channeling knowledge (information and know-how) to peripheral ﬁrms in different forms and at different codiﬁcation levels, leading to spiraling interactions between tacit and explicit knowledge (Nonaka, 1994).

With respect to R&D (Table 2, Phase 1), in 301 projects, we found core ﬁrms sharing infor- mation about development cycles with periph- eral ﬁrms to ease prototype development and gain time/cost efﬁciencies. Core ﬁrms transferred information and techniques on product concepts and assembly designs to suppliers in nearly one- third of the projects we studied, and they also (to a lesser extent) shared detailed blueprints and offered speciﬁc training about product con- cepts and design-for-assembly logics and tech- niques. Other core ﬁrm practices we observed included: preparing manuals outlining practices and rules for R&D interactions, supporting pur- chasing costs of R&D tools, and licensing pro- prietary technologies to peripheral ﬁrms. Trans- ferring tacit knowledge effectively requires exten- sive personal contact and trust and the supplier developing codiﬁcation processes to transform it into explicit knowledge. At the operations level (Table 3, Phase 1), practices supporting outbound knowledge ﬂows included: sharing detailed pro- duction schedules with suppliers, checkup visits to their company and plant, organizing and delivering training about production methods and working practices (such as just-in-time and lean production principles) to align and synchronize manufacturing and assembly processes. Core ﬁrms also arranged training on statistical quality control methods and quality performance indicators to assist suppli- ers with quality assurance and quality certiﬁca- tion, as well as on ICT and enterprise resource planning (ERP) platforms, inventory management techniques, and plant management principles. A number of practices covered other upstream and downstream activities (Table 4, Phase 1). For instance, core ﬁrms revealed proprietary informa- tion about market forecasts and trends to their Strat.

Core ﬁrms also established communication initiatives aimed at helping suppliers ﬁnd new markets to increase their abilities to identify and enter new markets (often related to racing events) to help improve their ﬁnancial stability: shaping joint visions and seizing market opportunities allowed these part- ners to develop joint dynamic capabilities. Phase 2—Knowledge ﬂows from peripheral ﬁrms to core ﬁrms Peripheral ﬁrms relying simply on markets to access specialized assets and acquire technology are likely to see their capabilities deteriorate (Teece, 1986) and to remain stuck in passive, dependent postures (Rosenberg, 1982). Periph- erals that purposefully supply core ﬁrms with return knowledge turn their relationships into partnerships, making it harder for core ﬁrms to switch to other suppliers. In terms of inbound R&D knowledge (Table 2, Phase 2), our study depicts peripheral ﬁrms as providing special- ized knowledge and technical information: by sharing proprietary technology and know-how, including alerting their partners about advances in state-of-the-art technologies and proposing design alternatives to allow them to fulﬁll their customers’ unique demands more completely. Other practices included: organizing training sessions to develop design-sharing capabilities, developing rapid pro- totyping techniques, and using simulation-driven design to give core partners with signiﬁcant engi- neering cost beneﬁts and more effective design analysis. At the operations level (Table 3, Phase 2), suppliers shaped their knowledge ﬂows to core ﬁrms by investing in highly specialized ﬁnishing processes and treatments, a practice we observed in nearly one-ﬁfth of the projects and which bene- ﬁtted a wide range of activities including product and process feasibility, surfacing, structural anal- ysis, and prototype engineering. Peripheral ﬁrms also transferred knowledge embedded in updated production scheduling programs, made consider- able investments in developing quality production capabilities, and offered preventive maintenance of core ﬁrms’ production machinery—ﬂows that were enabled by their possession of dedicated manufacturing tools, CNC machines, CAD-CAM working stations, and ﬂexible manufacturing sys- tems. Such inbound ﬂows also extended to other upstream and downstream activities (Table 4, Phase 2). Peripheral ﬁrms provided core ﬁrms with detailed price breakdowns and supported the preparation of technical speciﬁcations and documents for ﬁnal users, building core ﬁrms’ reliability and reputation. Their practices extended to sharing information about complementary sources of components and technology, which may seem to be counterintuitive behavior, but was aimed at reinforcing network potential and effectiveness and supporting core ﬁrms’ reactions to market opportunities, e.g., by speedy response to changing vehicle emissions regulations. Phase 3—Simultaneous, bidirectional knowledge ﬂows between core and peripheral ﬁrms In Phase 3, ﬁrms reciprocally exchange knowledge and cocreate ‘collaborative knowledge’ (Simonin, 1997), a prerequisite for virtuous relational learn- ing. In terms of R&D at this phase (Table 2, Phase 3), design engineers on both sides of the dyads recognized the value of working together on projects to share expertise, foster problem solving, and improve the efﬁciency and quality of prod- uct development: the interaction inherent in these knowledge-enhancing practices nourished virtu- ous cycles of reciprocal learning. In the projects we studied, we observed structured meetings to exchange information and know-how to ﬁx prob- lems rapidly, as well as recurrent codesign and co-engineering activities at component and mod- ule levels, joint testing, and the systematic paral- lel updating of partners’ CAD models to reduce design times and costs, allowing both parties to rapidly assess concept, development, and total lead times via interﬁrm ties. Hosting partners’ engi- neering teams supported simultaneous knowledge exchanges, and our data also revealed a signif- icant number of relational platforms (or ‘cus- tomer trial centers,’ as one core company labeled them) where teams of engineers from core and peripheral ﬁrms interacted to solve speciﬁc prob- lems. Joint participation in racing also enhanced both parties’ knowledge and supported their R&D activities, as many innovations developed for rac- ing bikes were later featured in retail production Strat.

Lipparini, G. Lorenzoni, and S. Ferriani models. At the operations level (Table 3, Phase 3), monthly meetings were arranged in one-ﬁfth of the projects we studied, allowing them to constantly assess the ‘pull’ logic, increasing core/periphery alignment and time efﬁciency and lowering coordi- nation costs. We also noted how parties interacted to jointly assess lean manufacturing principles and techniques and employed value stream mapping to raise their cost and time efﬁciency and their effectiveness in attaining manufacturing goals. Other practices supporting bidirectional knowl- edge ﬂows included: synchronizing purchasing orders and optimizing warehouse stock volumes, jointly implementing integrated enterprise resource planning (ERP), and using ‘quality circle’ initia- tives to cut defects and waste. In the ‘other activ- ities’ sphere (Table 4, Phase 3), we saw evidence of joint assessment of end user proﬁles to improve response effectiveness and participation in fund- raising projects to increase resource availability. Coevolutionary alignment took the form of the periodic updating of communication and informa- tion ﬂows needed to respond quickly to environ- mental jolts or to competitors’ moves. Phase 4—Knowledge ﬂows between peripheral ﬁrms In the fourth model phase, we observed knowl- edge ﬂowing between different peripheral ﬁrms, whose connection had been promoted and sup- ported by a common core ﬁrm. Largely unexplored by strategic literature, this guided evolution of learning processes from dyads to networks yields signiﬁcant insight into how core ﬁrms connect alters to gain informational (Burt, 2000) and other difﬁcult-to-replicate network-speciﬁc advantages. Redeploying knowledge dispersed across collabo- rative networks requires that core ﬁrms possess (or develop) learning and teaching capabilities across organizational boundaries, as this targeted coordi- nation of knowledge mobility is central to a net- work’s ability to co-create value and innovation (Zhao et al., 2005). As for R&D (Table 2, Phase 4), we observed knowledge exchange and cre- ation between peripheral ﬁrms being accomplished by: training suppliers on improving team working skills for greater effectiveness across dyads and networks, transferring methods and techniques to stimulate co-design activities among ﬁrst-tier sup- pliers, and organizing workshops and seminars on R&D organizing principles at the network level. Core ﬁrms supported such intersupplier knowledge ﬂows by identifying second-tier suppliers with complementary R&D capabilities. At the opera- tions level (Table 3, Phase 4), core ﬁrms extended effective supply chain and manufacturing activities across their networks by organizing workshops and coaching sessions, transferring methods and tech- niques to stimulate coordination among ﬁrst-tier suppliers, and providing training to diffuse plan- ning tools covering a range of activities from initial orders to delivery. To a lesser extent, we also saw core ﬁrms play active roles in helping peripherals manage the initial stages of their interrelationships, such as helping develop joint manufacturing plans. In other areas (Table 4, Phase 4), core ﬁrms orga- nized sessions between peripheral ﬁrms on market forecasts and identiﬁed synergies across differ- ent alliances. Core ﬁrms’ ability to lead by shar- ing strategy also hinged on them sharing lessons learned, databases, and potential partner proﬁles to create further opportunities for their suppli- ers. Core ﬁrms ran coaching sessions to reinforce the network’s goal alignment and helped suppliers elaborate ‘network contracts’ to give them unique identities in fund-raising applications. 4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION We present a structured framework that takes a multilevel perspective to address different rela- tional subsets, depicting knowledge ﬂows at dyad and network levels. We found core ﬁrms that took charge of the processes of interﬁrm learn- ing from ﬁrms to dyads, and from dyads to net- works, and of knowledge-enhancing practices all needed to nurture the transfer, recombination and creation of specialized knowledge. Such practices are favoring the afﬁrmation of higher-order orga- nizing principles (Grant, 1996), the idiosyncratic learning processes (Kotabe et al., 2003), and the interﬁrm knowledge-sharing routines (Dyer and Singh, 1998). The network we studied combined the advantages of common identity and lan- guage normally associated with hierarchical forms (Kogut and Zander, 1992; Conner and Prahalad, 1996) with the learning incentives that typically occur in dyads and networks.

The whole network, thus, becomes more expert at captur- ing opportunities, developing new products, and extracting technical and organizational capabili- ties both from current ties and from dormant or unexpected contacts (Kane, 2010). In our setting, the threat of opportunism appears to have been more than outweighed by the advantages of: learn- ing from other partners (Lorenzoni and Lipparini, 1999), including developing joint ‘interaction rou- tines’ (Nelson and Winter, 1982), making it easier for ﬁrms to modify existing behavior patterns as needed and improving transactive knowledge—about who knows what—to better enable information transfer (Reagans, Argote, and Brooks, 2005). These incentives help ﬁrms per- ceive networks as ‘safe places’ where ideas and knowledge can be exchanged, but with reduced risk of knowledge spillovers to competitors who share the same partners (Lester and Piore, 2004). Our ﬁndings suggest that all else being equal, the most successful learning processes will accrue in dyads and networks where both sources and recipients possess the requisite knowledge trans- fer capacity. A company’s capacity to effectively deploy knowledge is only as strong as the weakest partner in its innovation value chain, so unilat- eral ﬂows of knowledge to third parties do not guarantee the sustainability of any advantage. We contribute to explaining why some dyads and net- works succeed in learning faster than their com- petitors (Dyer and Nobeoka, 2000), enabling their partner ﬁrms to achieve their strategic objectives (Zollo, Reuer, and Singh, 2002). Our study also contributes to clarifying the role of ﬁrm capabil- ities in alliances and, in particular, the capabil- ities they need when entering alliances. Extant contributions have carefully examined alliance (Kale, Dyer, and Singh, 2002), relational (Loren- zoni and Lipparini, 1999) or boundary-bridging (Takeishi, 2001) and orchestration capabilities (Dhanaraj and Parkhe, 2006), and we add to this list the capacity for transferring and creat- ing knowledge (Smith, Collins, and Clark, 2005) which we show is needed by all parties in dyads and networks. Future research could reﬁne and build on this study in several directions: it could empirically determine which network structure dimensions are most likely to inﬂu- ence project outcomes, as well as examine the relationship between project phases, knowledge- enhancing activities, and outcomes. Equally inter- esting would be to study whether informal, distant, or infrequent relationships—rather than strong recurring ties among a small number of buyers and suppliers—lead to more or less efﬁcient knowl- edge sharing (Hansen et al., 2005). It would also be interesting to consider ‘negative ties’ (Labianca and Brass, 2006), given that many of the core ﬁrms in our sample are competitors. As to this, it could be interesting to examine how competitive relationships between core ﬁrms might inﬂuence, for instance, choices about forming ties with spe- ciﬁc peripheral ﬁrms that are already tied to rivals (Gimeno, 2004), therefore gaining a deeper under- standing of both the ‘structure of cooperation’ (Ahuja, 2000) and the structure of competition.
