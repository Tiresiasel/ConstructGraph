Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. INTRODUCTION A firm’s success and viability are contingent on the quality of its human capital (Coff and Kryscynski, 2011; Paruchuri, 2010). Consequently, many organizations make significant investments in maintaining their star employees, who are regarded as highly productive and who have superior vis- ibility in the external market (Groysberg, Lee, and Nanda, 2008; Oldroyd and Morris, 2012). In research environments, stars inventors are commonly believed to positively affect firms’ innovative productivity, not only directly through their individual contributions, but also indirectly by providing knowledge spillovers that improve their colleagues’ productivity (Zucker and Darby, Keywords: star employee; expert power; human capital; resource-based view; innovative performance *Correspondence to: Rebecca R. Kehoe, Janice H. Levin Build- ing, Suite 216 Rutgers University, 94 Rockafeller Road, Piscat- away, NJ 08854. E-mail: kehoe@smlr.rutgers.edu Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. 1997). The organizational resources and attention conferred to a star may, however, limit the oppor- tunities of other, non-star, inventors to provide innovative leadership (i.e., to initiate and indepen- dently lead innovation). The development of other potential innovative leaders in an organization is particularly important as it causes a firm to be less dependent on a star for innovation and thus less vulnerable to disruption of its innovation activities in the face of star turnover (Coff, 1999). Despite an increasing research focus on stars’ positive effects on firm performance, the extant lit- erature is silent on the potential for star inventors to have dual effects on organizations’ innovative performance. Further, and more importantly, while research suggests that key employees may occupy different internal positions in a firm’s workflow (Ibarra, 1993; Paruchuri, 2010), we know little about how the effects of stars vary based on these positions and on the social interdependen- cies associated with them. To delve into these 710 R.R.KehoeandD.Tzabbar issues, we draw on two key concepts from resource dependence theory: power imbalance and mutual dependence (Casciaro and Piskorski, 2005; Emer- son, 1962). From this perspective, we address two key questions concerning stars’ effects on firm performance—namely, how does the presence of a star affect innovative productivity and leadership, and under what conditions do these effects vary? First, we suggest that stars’ discretion over the tacit knowledge underlying the generation of suc- cessful innovations and the tangible organizational resources funneled to support a star’s research cre- atesapowerimbalancebetweenstarsandtheircol- leagues. As a result, stars exert disproportionate influence over an organization’s research direction and program, which in turn influences other scien- tists’ opportunities for innovative productivity and leadership. Second, we suggest that the relative balance in the mutual dependence (or bilateral dependencies) between a star and his colleagues may moderate stars’effectsoncolleagues’innovativeperformance (Casciaro and Piskorski, 2005), and we identify two key factors in determining this balance in knowledge-intensive firms: the star’s collaborative strength in the firm and the breadth of the star’s expertise. By fostering trust and tacit knowledge exchange,collaborativestrengthbetweenastarand his colleagues creates greater balance in depen- dence.Thebreadthofastar’sexpertiseincreasesthe scope and number of colleagues over whom a star mayexertinfluence,aswellasthestar’sdependence oncolleaguesforsupportinthestar’sownresearch.

We develop a contingency model to examine the relationship between the presence of a star and the innovativeproductivityandinnovativeleadershipin anorganization,andtoaddressthequestionsofhow and under what conditions these effects vary. We test our predictions with a study of 456 dedicated U.S. biotechnology firms in the time period from 1973 to 2003. Our study advances knowledge on the influence of stars on their firms’ innovative performance in several ways. First, we transcend prior findings focusing on stars’ positive influences through a knowledge spillover perspective by incorporating a resource dependence approach, which enables us to identify the dual influences that stars exert on firms’ innovative performance. Although we replicate previous findings that stars benefit their organizations’ productivity (Hess and Rothaermel, 2011; Rothaermel and Hess, 2007), we underscore that a star’s presence also constrains the emergence of other innovative leaders in a firm. Second, we demonstrate that stars’ effects on firms’ innovative performance vary based not only on the type of performance outcome, but also on the relative bal- ance in stars’ relationships with their colleagues. By integrating human capital theory with the resource dependence literature, we offer insights for cross-disciplinary assessments of the role that high-status individuals play in the development of a firm’s human capital and sustained competitive advantage. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND Inknowledge-basedindustries,afirm’shumancap- ital provides the scientific foundation and creative imagination necessary to identify opportunities for knowledge to be combined and recombined (Tzabbar, Aharonson, and Amburgey, 2013). The knowledge-based view promotes a “democratic notion” of the firm in which employees undertake specialized activities in the innovation process and learn different things about the transformation of inputs into outputs (Spender, 1996). Knowledge is perceived as a “private good,” which requires discretion in the sharing of employees’ expertise and transformation of tacit knowledge in order for other employees to learn what an individual has discovered (Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995). Similar to the knowledge-based view, resource dependence theory recognizes that a key deter- minant of organizational behavior is the mutual dependence in social relationships, which is gov- erned by individuals’ discretion over their key resource—knowledge. The mutual dependence between two actors is influenced by the importance of the resource that each actor holds for the other actor’s performance, the extent of each actor’s discretion over the use of the resources desired by theotheractor,andtheextenttowhichtheresource or an adequate substitute is available to each actor through alternative sources. Within a firm, when individuals or units hold discretion over resources that are critical to organizational functioning and no adequate substitute is readily available, these actors tend to have more influence (Pfeffer, 1981).

Thus, stars—identified as individuals who have demonstrated disproportionately high levels of performance and have superior visibility in the external market (Groysberg etal., 2008)—enjoy power and social status based on the value, complexity, and uniqueness of their exceptional expertise (French and Raven, 1959). As a result, stars tend to assume central roles in a firm’s workflow structure (Paruchuri, 2010) and control the flow of key resources within and between firm boundaries (Zucker, Darby, and Torero, 2002), creatinganimbalanceintheexchangerelationships between stars and other organizational members. This imbalance is reinforced by stars’ control over the use of their knowledge by others and by the prestige that makes stars desirable role models and partnersinexchange(Thye,2000).Incombination, these factors make stars’ superior expertise and positive influence on a firm’s research program evenmorevaluableanddifficulttoreplace(Zucker, Darby, and Brewer, 1998). Star inventors’ expert status positions them to affect both the innovative productivity and inno- vative leadership in a firm. Innovative productivity reflects a firm’s achievement of repeated innova- tive success and requires a firm to have the ability to access and effectively utilize the knowledge and tangible resources required for effective research in a defined domain (Nelson and Winter, 1982; Paruchuri, 2010). Innovative leadership is defined as the ability of a firm’s members to initiate and leadinnovation,andthusultimatelydefinesafirm’s capacity to attain continuous innovative productiv- ity (Dosi, 1982; Teece, Pisano, and Shuen, 1997). In the case of innovative productivity, the incen- tive of a star to sustain his high-status position by maintaining high levels of innovative produc- tivity is aligned with the firm’s and colleagues’ innovation goals. In particular, a star’s investment in providing his colleagues with opportunities for innovativeproductivitymayenhancethestar’sown productivity and prestige and contribute to organi- zational goals for innovative success at the same time. However, investing in colleagues’ innovative leadership opportunities may not so closely align with a star’s own goals. Specifically, advancing colleagues’ innovative leadership requires a star to share tacit knowledge and resources to support colleagues’ research initiatives (Zollo and Winter, 2002). Such investments may limit a star’s ability to pursue his own research agenda and sustain his unique position as an innovative leader in the firm (Overbeck and Park, 2006). Thus, a star’s presence mayunderminecolleagues’opportunitiestoemerge as innovative leaders. Star inventors’ desires to preserve their unique positions and firms’ expectations for stars to lead research, however, are not always consistent with other demands and expectations that emerge in the context of a star’s interdependencies within a firm (Astley and Sachdeva, 1984). As much as the firm and a star’s colleagues depend on the star’s exper- tise, the star is also dependent on the firm’s will- ingnesstoprovidetangibleandintangibleresources tosupportthestar’swork.Furthermore,tomaintain their advantageous status, stars must achieve some minimumlevelofsymmetryintheirexchangeswith colleagues,suchthatboththeyandtheircolleagues benefit from their interactions (Piskorski and Cas- ciaro, 2006). Should a star fail to fulfill this expec- tation, his colleagues may respond by assigning the star lower status, demonstrating less openness to the star’s influence (Willer, 2009), or reducing the extent to which they engage with the star in the future (Piskorski and Casciaro, 2006). Further, while it is within the firm’s interest to support the star,thefirmalsohasanincentivetolimititsdepen- dence on a star by developing the capabilities (e.g., innovativeleadership)ofotherscientistsinthefirm, astheexistenceofothercapableinventorsimproves the likelihood of continued success for the firm should the star depart (Coff, 1997; Tzabbar and Kehoe, 2014). Such mutual dependence defines the nature of exchange between the star and the firm. The incentive that stars have to preserve their own unique positions while fostering mutual benefits in theirexchangeswithcolleaguesexplainstheduality weexpecttofindintheeffectsthatstarshaveonan organization’s performance. From this perspective, ultimately, the effect of a star’spresenceoninnovativeproductivityandlead- ership in a firm will be determined by the extent to which the mutual dependence between a star and his colleagues in the firm is balanced, with more balanced relationships increasing the star’s moti- vation to ensure that colleagues benefit from their exchange with the star.

In turn, a star with high collaborative strength with colleagues is likely to feel less threatened by the potential reduc- tions in the criticality of his expertise and by the emergence of potential substitution for his knowl- edgeamongotherscientistsinthefirm.Thebreadth of a star’s expertise defines the scope of the col- leagues within the firm for whom the star’s key resources (i.e., knowledge and guidance) are rele- vant, and thus the scope of the indirect influence the star may exert in the organization. At the same time, breadth in a star’s expertise increases the star’s dependence on his colleagues for support in researchinitiativesacrossalargerrangeofdomains. Thus,weexpectgreaterbreadthinastar’sexpertise tobeassociatedwithincreasedbalanceinthestar’s mutual dependence with colleagues as well. HYPOTHESES Stars’ effects on their firms’ innovative performance With respect to performance record, expertise, rep- utation, and network centrality, star scientists are positioned at the extremes of many status-oriented spectra. Their presence in an organization has a significant influence on a firm’s innovative produc- tivity both directly through their individual perfor- mance and indirectly through means that extend beyond the contributions they make in their indi- vidualwork.Inparticular,astar’spresenceislikely to positively impact the quantity and quality of col- leagues’researchefforts,therebyimprovingafirm’s productivity. Stars’ deep knowledge enables them to identify the most promising research opportuni- ties (Zuckeretal., 1998). As reputable experts and central players in the scientific community, stars have access to and discretion over expert knowl- edge, tangible resources, and influential actors in the external and internal environment (Liebeskind etal., 1996; Zucker etal., 1998), providing stars unique opportunities to continuously execute suc- cessful innovation, thereby contributing to their firms’ innovative productivity. Stars can have less direct effects on their orga- nizations’ productivity as well. As a result of the increased quantity and fruitfulness of innovative activities driven by star inventors, other scientists in the star’s firm also enjoy more opportunities to pursue research. Since star inventors exert dispro- portionate control over a firm’s research agenda, a star’s presence tends to promote a well-defined and well-funded research program. Specifically, the presence of a star provides other scientists in a firm with improved access to tangible and intangible resources, offering these scientists better opportunities to identify, evaluate, and pursue var- ious innovative activities relative to peers in firms that do not have such access (Paruchuri, 2010). Further, through vicarious learning and behav- ioral modeling, scientists working alongside a star may enact behavioral norms conducive to research productivity (Wood and Bandura, 1989). Conse- quently, a star’s colleagues encounter less uncer- taintyandfewerhurdlesassociatedwithinnovation, ultimatelycontributingtoincreasedproductivityfor the organization as a whole (Zuckeretal., 1998). In contrast, employees without the example of a starfacegreaterdifficultiesinachievinghighlevels of productivity based on fewer available opportuni- ties and on the lack of a role model from whom to learn the most effective work practices for innova- tion (Burke, Fournier, and Prasad, 2007). Nevertheless, the contributions of knowledge, resources, and guidance that stars make to a firm’s research program do not come without costs. In particular, stars’ central roles in a firm’s work- flow structure and control of key organizational resourcescausethefirmanditsother(i.e.,non-star) scientists to grow dependent on the star’s exper- tiseandinnovativeleadership(Paruchuri,2010).As much of the firm’s tangible resources and human resourcesareallocatedtosupportthestar’sresearch program,otherscientistsarelikelytohavelesstime and fewer resources available to pursue their own researchagendas(HuckmanandPisano,2006),thus reducing their opportunities to assume leadership positions in the firm’s innovative activities. Further, stars and other scientists in a firm may have conflicting interests with respect to the emergence of non-star scientists as innovative leaders.Inparticular,astarmayviewthesharingof tangible resources and tacit knowledge to advance Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Thus, stars may be less eager to invest in colleagues’ innovative leadership than they are in colleagues’ productivity and thus may limit their sharing of knowledge and resources for this purpose. In contrast, in a more symmetric social structure (e.g., when no star is present), resources are more evenly distributed. Symmetric social structures have also been demonstrated to encourage broader involvement, enhance knowledge sharing, and increase the willingness and opportunity of all individuals to take initiative in collective efforts (Bunderson, 2003a, 2003b; Edmondson, 2002). As a result, in such contexts, a larger number of scientistsarelikelytoassumeinnovativeleadership in the firm’s research efforts. Accordingly, we hypothesize: Hypothesis1a:Thepresenceofastarincreases afirm’sinnovativeproductivity . Hypothesis1b:Thepresenceofastardecreases innovative leadership among a firm’s non-star scientists. The roles of the breadth of a star’s expertise and star’s collaborative strength However, as innovation involves behavioral inter- dependencies, the nature of a star’s effects on col- leagues’ innovative productivity and leadership is likely to vary with the extent to which the star’s mutual dependence with other scientists is bal- anced. Specifically, we consider how stars’ effects on their firms’ productivity and innovative leader- ship vary with the degree to which a star’s exper- tise spans a broad range of technologies and with the collaborative strength reflected in the star’s co-invention with his colleagues in the firm. Thebreadthofastar’sexpertise The breadth of a star’s expertise reflects the range of technological domains across which the star pursues research and can thus provide relevant, timely knowledge and access to opportunities for a firm. Therefore, the breadth of a star’s expertise reflects both the scope of a star’s expert power, as well as the range of technological domains across which a star may require support in innovative initiatives, suggesting important implications for the interdependencies between a star and the other scientists in a firm. Relative to stars with narrow expertise, stars with broader expertise are likely to enjoy greater internal prominence and centrality. This centrality provides a star with opportunities to provide knowledge and research guidance relevant to more colleagues in the organization. This broader reach of the star’s guidance increases the number of fruitful research opportunities and the likelihood of success in innovation for the organization as a whole. In particular, broader expertise enables a star to be involved in directing more varied research initiatives and to identify more unique knowledgerecombinationopportunitiesthroughout an organization. The knowledge held by a star with broader expertise is also likely to be relevant to a larger pool of colleagues in the star’s firm. This expertise reduces uncertainty and increases the likelihood of success associated with the research initiatives of a larger portion of the firm’s human capital. Increased prominence also enhances the desirability of the star as a role model in the firm (Nerkar and Paruchuri, 2005). This position allows the star to indirectly shape the attitudes, norms, and behaviors of a larger portion of the firm’s workforce more easily (Wood and Bandura, 1989), thereby facilitating work patterns conducive to greater productivity of the firm as a whole. However, direct involvement in and control over multipleinnovativeprojectsmaystrainastar’scog- nitive capacity and thus threaten the star’s ability to effectively oversee the successful completion of many varied research initiatives. In particu- lar, broader involvement in multiple domains of researchwithinafirmrequiresgreatercoordination, communication,andcontrol,representingincreased draws on the star’s time and attention. Given indi- viduals’ (including stars’) finite cognitive capaci- ties, at a certain point, constant information flows to and from a star may cause the star to experi- ence social and informational overload (Schroder, Driver, and Streufert, 1967). Such overload may hinder the star’s ability to effectively communicate his knowledge or guidance to colleagues (Oldroyd andMorris,2012)andobviateanypotentialbenefits of additional breadth in the star’s expertise.

Empirical evidence lends support to this argu- mentaswell,withpreviousresearchdemonstrating thatinformationoverloadreducesemployees’moti- vation to share information (Kirsh, 2001) and, in turn, hampers learning outcomes (Schillingetal., 2003). For this reason, we predict a nonlinear rela- tionship between the breadth of a star’s expertise and a firm’s innovative productivity. Specifically, we argue that at low to moderate levels, increased breadth in a star’s expertise will improve a firm’s overallinnovativeproductivity. Atveryhighlevels, however, we expect further increases in the breadth ofastar’sexpertisetohinderthestar’sabilitytohelp other scientists in their work, suggesting a limit to the positive relationship between the breadth of a star’sexpertiseandfirm-levelproductivity.Accord- ingly, we predict: Hypothesis 2a: There is a diminishing posi- tiverelationshipbetweenthebreadthofastar’s expertise and a firm’s innovative productivity. At low and moderate levels of breadth of a star’sexpertise,thefirm’sinnovativeproductiv- ity increases, but at higher levels of breadth of expertise,thispositiveeffectweakens . Thebreadthofastar’sexpertisealsohasimplica- tionsforthedegreetowhichthemutualdependence between the star and his colleagues is balanced. Whenastardrawshisstatusfromexpertknowledge across a broad range of technologies, we suggest thatmorebalancedpowerdynamicsmayemergein the star’s relationships with his colleagues. To prevent knowledge and social overload (Hen- dersonandCockburn,1994),andinordertoremain productive, stars with broad expertise are more likely to seek out and rely on the input and leader- ship of colleagues with specialized expertise in rel- evant domains. The resulting reciprocal exchange of knowledge is likely to create a balanced pattern ofmutualdependencebetweenthesestarsandtheir colleagues(CasciaroandPiskorski,2005).Further- more, for stars with broad expertise, the emergence of other potential innovative leaders poses less of a threat to the star’s unique position in the organi- zation, as the star’s centrality to the firm’s innova- tive activities is rooted both in his expertise across a plethora of technologies and in his ability to bridge scientists and knowledge gaps across many areas. As a result, stars with very broad expertise may develop more balanced patterns of intellec- tual exchange with their colleagues (Flynn, 2003), resulting in an increased willingness by (and per- hapsnecessityfor)thestartorelinquishcontroland invest time in sharing the tangible and intangible resourcesrequiredforcolleaguestoassumeinnova- tiveleadership(VanderVegt,Bunderson,andOost- erhof, 2006). In contrast, stars with narrow and moderate breadthintheirexpertisearelikelytobelessdepen- dent on other scientists’ contributions and thus may be less likely to maintain balanced intellec- tual exchanges with their colleagues. In particu- lar, such stars may be better able to manage all or most research initiatives in the domains of their expertise (as the number of domains is limited) and may thus leave fewer opportunities open for colleagues’ innovative leadership in these or other domains. Furthermore, when a star draws his sta- tus from expert power rooted in just one or a few knowledge domains, the star’s “expertness” is vul- nerable to redundancy when other scientists in the firm emerge and prove capable of leading research. Therefore,suchstarsmaybemorelikelytoassume a directive and protective stance in their exchange (CasciaroandPiskorski,2005),limitingthesharing of tacit knowledge that may enhance the innova- tive leadership opportunities of other scientists in the organization.

As a result, stars with high collaborative strength are likely to be more willing to share knowledge and resourcestosupportcolleagues’researchinitiatives (Collins and Smith, 2006; Reagans and McEvily, 2003).Onthisbasis,wesuggestthatastar’scollab- orative strength increases the abilities, motivation, andopportunitiesofboththestarandhiscolleagues for high levels of innovative productivity. Repeated collaboration between a star and his colleagues facilitates efficiency and effectiveness in knowledge transfer. When a star collaborates frequently, the star and his colleagues develop relationship-specific heuristics, a shared language and understanding, and common mental models (Kogut and Zander, 1992), reducing coordination costs in current and future joint innovative efforts (Vera and Crossan, 2005). More importantly, fre- quent collaboration weakens the prominence of socialboundaries,makingcommunicationbetween a star and his colleagues more symmetrical (Harri- sonetal., 2003). Relative to stars who are weakly connected in a firm,starswithhighcollaborativestrengtharemore central in their firm’s work flow (Paruchuri, 2010), enabling them to act as bridging ties between var- ious knowledge bases within the firm. By bridg- ing internal structural holes, collaborative stars can better identify unique knowledge recombina- tion opportunities and leverage the knowledge of local experts to capitalize on these opportunities for increased productivity for themselves and their colleagues(Hansen,1999).Further,strongrelation- ships increase a star’s desirability as a role model, causingmorecolleaguestoemulatethebehaviorsof these stars, which are conducive to innovative suc- cess (Wood and Bandura, 1989). Thus, we argue that, relative to stars with low collaborative strength, stars that collaborate exten- sively increase the firm’s collective opportunities for innovative productivity. Hypothesis 3a: A star’s collaborative strength increasesafirm’sinnovativeproductivity . Given that innovative leadership capabilities are rooted in individuals’ tacit knowledge, which is best acquired through learning-by-doing (Polanyi, 1966), repeated collaboration is the best means by which colleagues can gain a deep understanding of theinnovationprocessunderastar’sguidance.Col- laborationfacilitatesthetransferoftacitknowledge, as familiarity in relationships reduces the risk of opportunistic behavior, increasing the source’s and recipient’s willingness to share and accept knowl- edge(ReagansandMcEvily,2003)andtherebyfos- teringmorebalancedexchange(Granovetter,1982; Williamson, 1991). Familiarity is further likely to buttressastar’sbeliefthathiscolleagues’behaviors are rooted in fairness and increase the star’s con- cern for colleagues’ development and success (Van derVegt etal.,2009)andthusthestar’swillingness tosharehistacitknowledgetofacilitatecolleagues’ understanding of the innovation process (McEvily, Perrone, and Zaheer, 2003). Asfamiliarityincreasesbalancedexchange,stars whose exchanges with colleagues are character- ized by high collaborative strength are more likely to adopt an encouraging and participatory inter- action style, because they recognize the impor- tance of helping their colleagues develop deeper innovativecapabilities(NembhardandEdmondson, 2006). Consequently, such stars may be willing to increase the time and effort they invest in resolving transfer-relatedchallenges(Szulanski,2000)andin supporting colleagues’ innovative initiatives more broadly (Van der Vegtetal., 2009). In contrast, starswho collaborate less frequently with their col- leagues may be more focused on furthering their ownresearchagendasandlesswillingtoinvesttime and effort in their colleagues’ intellectual develop- ment.

Thejointeffectoftheextentofastar’s collaborativestrengthandthebreadthofastar’s expertiseonafirm’sinnovativeperformance Implicit in the arguments above is that stars vary both in their collaborative strength and in the breadth of their expertise. Accordingly, stars’ effects on colleagues’ performance may vary, both between stars with narrow and broad expertise, and within each of these groups, based on the degree to which a star collaborates with colleagues.

As a result, at highlevelsofbreadthinastar’sexpertise,extensive collaboration by the star may mitigate the tapering off of the positive effect that the star’s breadth of expertise has on a firm’s innovative productivity by enabling colleagues to share some of the informa- tion processing burden that may otherwise strain the star’s cognitive capacity. In this way, such stars may be able to leverage their mutual dependence withcolleaguestobenefitboththestar’sandhiscol- leagues’ innovative productivity simultaneously. In contrast, when a star has low levels of collab- orativestrengthwithcolleagues,thepotentialbene- fitsassociatedwiththestar’sbroadknowledgemay be limited by a lack of exchange opportunities and sharedcommunicationcapabilitiesbetweenthestar and other scientists in the organization. This con- straintnecessarilyreducesthebalanceinthemutual dependence between the star and other scientists, as it leaves such stars without the option to del- egate information processing tasks to colleagues, thus providing fewer colleagues the opportunity to gain the knowledge and experience necessary to manage such tasks effectively. Furthermore, such stars are likely to be left to handle more informa- tion flows and requests on their own, increasing the likelihood of information overload. As a result, the increased breadth in the knowledge and resources the star brings to the organization may have a less positive effect on the firm’s productivity. Accord- ingly, we expect that collaboration by a star will strengthen the positive effect of the breadth of a star’s expertise on a firm’s innovative productivity. Hypothesis 4a: A star’s collaborative strength moderates the relationship between the breadth ofastar’sexpertiseandafirm’sinnovativepro- ductivity, such that high collaborative strength increasesthepositiveeffectofthestar’sbreadth ofexpertiseonthefirm’sinnovativeproductivity . Similarly, we expect a star’s collaborative strength to favorably influence the relationship betweenbreadthinastar’sexpertiseandinnovative leadership in an organization. Specifically, we predicted a U-shaped relationship between the breadth of a star’s expertise and innovative lead- ership. However, given that collaborative strength fosters familiarity and trust and contributes to a star’s interdependence with other scientists in a firm, stars with narrow expertise who collaborate frequently may adopt a more balanced pattern of exchange with colleagues and thus engage in less turf protection and increased knowledge sharing to promote the innovative leadership opportunities of others.Relativetoverycollaborativestars,lesscol- laborative stars with narrow expertise may be less embedded in their social networks, demonstrate less balanced mutual dependence with colleagues, and thus be more concerned about colleagues’ potential opportunistic behavior. Such fears may intensify these stars’ turf protection activities, such that they limit their sharing of tacit knowledge and innovative leadership opportunities with others. For stars with broad expertise, collaborative strength increases a star’s mutual dependence with colleagues.Specifically,undersuchconditionsstars are likely to depend more heavily on other sci- entists’ contributions in order to remain produc- tive across their multiple research areas. Such stars may be especially inclined to view their sharing of expertise and leadership opportunities as necessary to maintaining balanced exchanges with their col- leagues(VanderVegt etal.,2006).Incontrast,stars with broad expertise who seldom collaborate may be less concerned with sharing knowledge to main- tain balanced exchanges with other scientists. Hypothesis 4b: A star’s collaborative strength moderates the relationship between the breadth of a star’s expertise and a firm’s innovative leadership,suchthathighcollaborativestrength reduces the negative effect of low breadth of expertise on innovative leadership. In contrast, whenthestarhasanextensivebreadthofexper- tise, high collaboration increases the positive effect of breadth of expertise on innovative leadership. DATA AND METHODS Research setting We tested our hypotheses using data from the field of biotechnology, which exemplifies a knowledge-intensive, dynamic setting in which innovative productivity and leadership are reflected in scientists’ patenting activities.

These factors improve our ability to examine the directeffectofastarscientistonhiscolleaguesand point to the appropriateness and importance of this context in testing our theoretical model. We obtained data from a population of small, dedicated, and independent U.S. biotechnology firms founded between 1973 (the year of the Cohen-Boyer breakthrough involving recombinant DNA, often called the birth of modern biotech- nology) and 2003. We identified firms using BioScan, the most comprehensive historical list of U.S. biotechnology firms. We cross-checked this information with the U.S. Companies Database (BioWorld), compiled by the North Carolina Biotechnology Center. We excluded all firms that werefoundedbefore1973orthatwerenotindepen- dent entities (e.g., subsidiaries). The final sample consistsof456dedicatedU.S.biotechnologyfirms. We then compiled the life histories of all of these firms during the specified period and constructed a datasetofallofthepatentedinnovationsgenerated by these firms. Finally, we identified all of the scientists involved in each patented innovation. Dependent variables The focal outcomes in this study are a firm’s innovative productivity and innovative leadership. Following prior research (Ahuja and Katila, 2001), we used successful patenting as an indication of a firm’sinnovativeproductivity.Weweightedpatents by citations received in the fiveyears after issuance to account for variance in patents’ value (Sampson, 2007). Innovative leadership reflects the ability of a firm’s (non-star) scientists to initiate and lead research from innovation to patenting. We opera- tionalized innovative leadership as: Innovativeleadership = ∑ i j × ( n n−1 ) where ij represents the number of non-star inven- tors who applied for patents on which a star sci- entist was not a co-inventor. We corrected for the possibility that the number of inventors might bias the measure. Consistent with our theory, our focus was on identifying the number of unique inven- tors who patented without a star and who had thus demonstrated innovative leadership, rather than the number of patents applied for without a star. This approach also enabled us to cleanly separate the measure from increases in innovative productivity associatedwiththepresenceofastarwhileaccount- ing for the number of inventors in a firm. Hence, if non-starinventor iappliedforthreepatentswithout astarandnon-starinventor jappliedfortwopatents without a star, we assessed their collective innova- tive leadership with a score of 2 rather than 5. Independent variables Firmswithstars To test our first two hypotheses, we distinguished between firms employing at least one star inventor and those with no star inventors. We followed pre- vious research examining the biotechnology indus- try in identifying stars based on the quantity and impact of their cumulative research (Zucker and Darby,2001).Specifically,toidentifystarscientists, we used the following formula: InvPerformance = [( InvPat it IndTenureit ) ×AveForwardCiteit ] where InvPatit represents the number of patents for which scientist i applied by year t. We divided this number by scientisti’s industry tenure as of year t, represented by the number of years since the scientist’s first patent application. Given that forward citations in patents provide the best proxy forapatent’simpact,wemultipliedourcalculations by the average forward citations of scientist i’s patents received by yeart. Finally, we compared eachinventor’sproductivityscoreattime twiththe industry average. A scientist whose productivity score is at least two standard deviations above the average of all inventors in our sample is defined as a star. We allowedfornon-starscientiststobecomestarscien- tists over time by updating scientists’ scores annu- ally. We identified 531 star scientists during the studyperiod(about7%ofthescientistsinoursam- ple)whowereemployedby155firms.Accordingly, we followed the standard procedure and opera- tionalized the star firm as a dummy variable, where Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Breadthofastar’sexpertise In the biotechnology context, expertise is reflected in the breadth and depth of technological field in which a scientist patents. Accordingly, we assessed a star scientist’s technological portfolio using all patent applications with which the star was involved. We conceptualized breadth of star exper- tise as the diversification in technological classes associated with a star’s patents. Using Tzabbar’s (2009) 22 technological fields, we indexed each fieldby j=1, …,22,sothatthe N i patentsthatsci- entistihadattime tcouldeachbeassignedatechno- logicalfield.Welet Nij denotethenumberofpatents theith scientist holds in categoryj. Subtracting this value from 1, the breadth of expertise variable is: Breadthof StarExpertise = [ 1− 22∑ j=1 (Nij Ni )2] WethenfollowedHall(2002)andusedanonbiased Herfindahl index for citations. As some firms have more than one star scientist, weexaminedtheeffectofthebreadthofexpertiseof the star with the highest level of expertise breadth. Star’scollaborativestrength Consistent with previous research, we examined the breadth and frequency of stars’ co-inventions with colleagues to capture star-colleague collabo- ration (Uzzi, 1996). Specifically, we computed a star’s collaborative strength as the average level of co-invention frequency between star and non-star scientists in firms, Star collaborative strength = ∑ Ns i=1 ∑Ns j=1 zijs max(zijs),j≠ i Ns (Ns −1) where zijs (𝜖 {0,1,2,3,4}) is the frequency with which star scientisti co-invents with team mem- bers j,m a x(zijs) is the largest possible number of collaboration ties that star scientist i could have within the firm, and Ns is the number of m e m b e r si nfi r ms. Collaborative strength varies from 0 (no co-invention) to 1, which would imply a complete network containing all possible ties among incumbent scientists. To test Hypotheses 4a and b, we interacted collaborative strength with the breadth of a star’s expertise. To facilitate the interpretation of our results, we mean centered the moderating variable termsandenteredtheirmaineffectsintothemodel. Controls Firmcontrols To account for potential differences in the avail- abilityofresearchfunds,wecontrolledforwhether firms were publicly traded and for venture capi- tal raised. We also controlled for firm size (i.e., the number of employees in a firm) as reported in BioScan and for firm age as the number of years since incorporation. For firms that patented prior to incorporation, we used the number of years since their first patent application as firm age. Othersourcesofknowledgeflow Toaccountforotherknowledgeflowsthatwerenot includedinourtheoreticalmodel,wecontrolledfor recruitmentevents(codedtoequal1ifsuchanevent occurred in the previous threeyears, and 0 oth- erwise), geographic dispersion of R&D members (computed using an inverted Herfindahl index to assess geographic dispersion based on R&D mem- ber locations obtained from our patent data), and number of prior R&D alliances. Further, to capture other potential influences on a firm’s innovation processes, we controlled for firms’ technological breadth (using a Blau index to capture diversity in the areas across which a firm has patented (Tzabbar, 2009)) and CEO succession (whichwecodedbasedonwhetherafirmappointed a CEO who was not previously part of the firm’s top management team using data from BioScan reports about key personnel, hiring announcements in LexisNexis, and firm contacts).

The remaining hypotheses are focused on the characteristics of stars and thus required us to restrict our analyses to the 155 firms that employed at least one star inventor. Analysis The cross-sectional (across firms) and time-series (over years) data suggest the appropriateness of panel data methodology. We used generalized least squares (GLS) regression to test our hypotheses. One challenge in testing our model is that differ- ences between firms with and without star scien- tists could be attributed to initial differences in the quality of human capital between these firms. We addressed this issue in a few ways. First, we accounted for some of these differences by using a fixedeffectsmodel.Ourdataencompassedvirtually the entire population of dedicated and independent U.S.biotechnologyfirms,ratherthanrandomdraws from a population, obviating a key assumption of random effects (Wooldridge, 2003). A Hausman test also indicated significant (p<0.01) system- atic differences in the coefficients of the random effects versus fixed effects models, suggesting that the fixed effects models were more appropriate. Second, we corrected for potential endogeneity by using a two-stage Heckman selection proce- dure (Heckman, 1979). In the first stage, we gen- eratedaninverseMillsratio,whichaccountsforthe likelihood of recruiting a star inventor. Given that firms with high levels of innovative performance andqualityhumancapitalcanattractstarscientists, we examined the effect ofprior firm patentsand number of star inventorson star recruitment. We then included this Mills ratio as a coefficient in the second stage where we examined the effects of our theoretical variables. Descriptive statistics In Table 1, we present the means, standard devia- tions, and correlations among the independent and control variables. Variance inflation factors (VIFs) derived from an ordinary least squares regression and modest correlations between the independent variables suggested that multicollinearity problems were unlikely (highest VIF=2.67). We took addi- tionalstepstoavoidproblemswithmulticollinearity by centering the variables used to test the predicted interactions.Inadditiontomeancenteringtheinter- action terms, we tested the significance of groups of variables, compared against a series model, and examined the coefficients’ standard errors for infla- tiontoensurethatmulticollinearitywasnotcausing less precise parameter estimates (Kmenta, 1986).

Roles of breadth of a star’s expertise and degree of a star’s collaborative strength To determine whether the effect that stars have on their firms’ innovative performance varies accord- ing to a star’s collaborative strength and breadth of expertise, we focused our next analyses on the 155 firms in our sample that employed star scientists during the study period.

We tested Hypothesis 2b in Model 4. The results suggest that the breadth of a star’s expertise has a positive effect on innovative leadership for both the linear and quadratic term, respectively(𝛽=1.06;𝛽=0.27;p<0.01).Thus,we did not find support for a U-shaped relationship between star expertise breadth and innovative lead- ership.Instead,innovativeleadershipincreaseswith breadthinastar’sexpertise,butatadecreasingrate. The relationship between a star’s collaborative strength and innovative leadership is positive and significant(𝛽=0.57;p<0.01).Toexaminethejoint effect of star scientist’s collaborative strength and the breadth of their expertise on innovative leader- ship and to test Hypothesis 4b, we again interacted thesepredictors.AsModel4shows,thelineareffect of the interaction between collaborative strength and the breadth of a star’s expertise on innova- tive leadership is positive and significant (𝛽=0.27; p<0.01),andthesquaretermisnegativeandsignif- icant(𝛽=−1.89;p<0.01).AspredictedinHypoth- esis4b,theresultssuggestthatfirmsexperiencethe highestlevelsofinnovativeleadershipwhenastar’s expertiseisbroadandwhenthestarhashighcollab- orative strength, and the lowest levels of innovative leadershipwhenastar’sexpertiseisnarrowandthe star has weak collaborative strength. Additional analysis Our theory focuses on stars’ effects on firms’ inno- vative outcomes and when these effects vary. We examined whether the number of stars present in a firm affects these relationships in a supplemental analysis.AsshowninTable4,whilethestrengthof the predicted relationships varies with the presence of multiple stars, the results are consistent with our original findings. To test whether our focal theory of “global” star inventors (i.e., stars whose performance levels positionthematthetopofindustry-widestandards) generalizes to “local” stars (i.e., individuals whose performance levelsposition them atthe top offirm, but not industry-level standards), we developed a continuous measure of performance asymmetries among firms’ scientists (Tzabbar, 2009). In an unreported analysis, we found that local stars have similar, yet significantly weaker, effects as global stars on firms’ innovation outcomes. We further tested whether our paper’s findings vary based on whether innovation directly involves a star and/or occurs within versus outside a star’s areas of expertise. As shown in Table 5, we find that a star’s effect on innovative productivity is significantly stronger when the star serves as a co-inventor on patents and when innovation occurs within the star’s area of expertise. Table 5 also suggests that the presence of a star has a significant positive effect on innovative lead- ership within the star’s area of expertise (𝛽=0.09; p<0.05) and a significant negative effect on inno- vative leadership outside the star’s area of exper- tise(𝛽=−1.53;p<0.01).Theseresultssuggestthat a star’s greater dependence on support from col- leagues working within the star’s area of expertise mayresultinincreasedbalanceinthestar’srelation- ships, contributing to increased opportunities for such colleagues’ innovative leadership. In contrast, colleagues pursuing research outside a star’s areas of expertise may have less balanced relationships with the star and thus enjoy fewer innovative lead- ership opportunities. DISCUSSION Our results highlight the duality of the effects that star employees have on their firms’ performance. While stars benefit their organizations’ produc- tivity, their presence constrains the opportunities of other scientists in a firm to develop and use their innovative leadership capabilities. Our argu- ments and findings further demonstrate that the differential effects that stars have on their firms’ research environments—based on their collabora- tive strength with colleagues and the breadth of stars’expertise—areimportantdeterminantsofthe effects stars have on their firms’ innovative out- comes. As expected, relative to stars who collabo- rate rarely or not at all, the presence of stars with high collaborative strength improves both the pro- ductivityandinnovativeleadershipopportunitiesof other scientists in a firm. Furthermore, our results indicate that a firm’s innovative productivity and innovative leadership increase with greater breadth in a star’s expertise (although the positive effect of expertise breadth on productivity diminishes at very high levels of breadth in expertise).

The results thus reinforce an important theme in the strategic human capital literature—namely, that the value of human capi- tal is not absolute, but rather depends on how it is leveraged in a firm (Hittetal., 2001). Implications and contributions Our arguments and findings advance our under- standingoftheeffectsofstaremployeesontheper- formance of their colleagues and firms in several ways.First,theprevailingwisdomsuggeststhatstar employees create disproportionate value for orga- nizations by generating substantial increases in a firm’s productivity (Rothaermel and Hess, 2007). Assuming such a static and monolithic view of the influence of stars in organizations underestimates thecomplexnatureofstars’relationshipswiththeir colleagues and work environments. Moreover, the mechanisms by which such spillovers occur have yet to be theoretically grounded. By introducing a resourcedependenceperspectivetothiscontext,we capturethedualinfluencesthatstarsexertonfirms’ innovative performance and account for the mutual dependence inherent in stars’ exchanges within a firm. Further, the empirical findings that emerge from this perspective reinforce prior work, which suggeststhatstarsarenotallequalintheireffectson colleagues’ performance (Oettl, 2012) and that key individuals who are more central in a firm’s work- flowexertmoresignificantinfluencesonanorgani- zation’s performance (Paruchuri, 2010).

We also contribute to research on the effects of power and learning in organizations. Specifically, extant research in this vein suggests that power asymmetries stifle learning in organizations and calls for an examination of the mechanisms that may mitigate such constraining effects (Bunder- son and Reagans, 2011). Our theory highlights two factors (i.e., breadth of expertise and levels of collaborative strength) that increase the mutual dependence between high status individuals and theircolleagues,therebyreducingthepower-related barriers to effective learning and improving other scientists’ opportunities to achieve increased pro- ductivity in the presence of a star. Finally,byexaminingtheconditionsunderwhich stars’ effects on their firms’ performance vary, we advance research on the resource-based view (RBV)ofthefirm.ConsistentwiththeRBV,wepro- pose that when a firm’s research program is tightly boundtoanddependentonastar’sresearchagenda, interdependencies within the firm are likely to be imbalanced, and the star’s favorable effects on col- leagues’performancearelikelytobelimitedtopos- itive spillovers that naturally occur in the course of the star’s own innovative pursuits.

Limitations Relying on patent data to define our key vari- ablesraisessometraditionalconcerns,includingthe objections that not all patentable knowledge gets patented (Alcacer and Gittelman, 2006; Griliches, 1990). Nevertheless, biotechnology firms are likely to patent any patentable technologies due to the strong appropriability regime for patents in this industry. Our archival data cannot reveal a firm’s motives for hiring a star or selecting stars with particular characteristics. However, our regression analyses account for potential endogenous vari- ables and firms’ heterogeneity, thereby reducing the potential for alternative interpretations of our results.Theriskofendogeneityandselectionbiasis also minimal, because our theory explores how the effectsofstarsvary.Weemphasizethatstarsvaryin their propensities to affect a firm’s innovative per- formance, based on both the type of performance outcome and the factors that affect the mutual dependence in stars’ exchanges with colleagues. Future research would benefit from an examination ofoutcomestiedtostarmobilitybetweenfirms.The limited number of star mobility events in our data prevented such an assessment in this study. CONCLUSION Organizational scholars and managers should also recognizethatwhereasstarsmayimprovetheover- all productivity of their colleagues and firms and thus maximize an organization’s opportunities for short-termperformancegains,thepresenceofastar can also hinder other scientists’ opportunities to develop as innovative leaders, which may threaten the long-term value associated with a firm’s collec- tive human capital. Further, stars may offer knowl- edge and resources that are not currently available to a firm, but firms rarely build innovative capabili- ties through this path alone. To exploit the benefits associated with employing a star, firms must moti- vate stars to share their knowledge, as well as grant other scientists opportunities to develop new skills whilealsolearninghowtoleadinnovation.Further- more, factors that influence the mutual dependence between stars and their colleagues (such as a star’s collaborative strength and breadth of expertise) are critical in determining the effects stars are likely to have on the innovative productivity and innova- tive leadership in their firms. Our study provides a deeper understanding of how the social interde- pendenciesbetweenstarsandtheircolleaguesshape stars’ effects on firm performance.
