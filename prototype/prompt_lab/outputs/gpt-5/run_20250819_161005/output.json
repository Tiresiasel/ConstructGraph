Such node collapse can radically restructure the network by modifying multiple ties in a single transaction, producing revolutionary change compared with incremental tie additions/deletions. It creates externalities for other actors and provides the acquirer with control over both internal resources (owned by the target) and external resources (accessed via inherited network ties).",
