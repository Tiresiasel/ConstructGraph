    "L1_summary_of_paper": "This study develops and empirically tests a dynamic process model of competitive interaction, conceptualizing strategy as an ordered sequence of competitive actions (‘competitive attacks’) over time. Using data on thousands of competitive actions among the top two firms in 16 U.S. industries (1987–1993), the paper defines competitive aggressiveness through four attack dimensions: volume (number of actions per attack), duration (time span of attack), complexity (diversity of action types), and unpredictability (variation in action sequences across attacks). The model specifies antecedents—top management team (TMT) heterogeneity, past performance, organizational slack, and industry context (growth, concentration, entry barriers)—and links these to attack characteristics. It then relates attack characteristics to market share gains, positing linear effects for volume and duration, and curvilinear (increasing) effects for complexity and unpredictability. Findings show that TMT heterogeneity increases attack complexity but reduces duration; past good performance reduces duration; slack increases volume and duration; and competition-buffered industries dampen aggressiveness. On outcomes, higher volume and longer duration attacks improve market share, while complexity and unpredictability show U-shaped rather than predicted monotonic effects. The paper contributes to competitive dynamics by introducing the sequence-level analysis of competitive behavior, integrates upper echelons and industry-structure perspectives, and refines understanding of how internal and external factors shape and constrain sustained competitive aggressiveness.",
