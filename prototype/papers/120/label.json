      "L1_summary_of_paper": "This paper introduces and tests the construct of 'competitor acumen,' defined as the extent to which a focal firm's assessment of a given rival's prioritization of its own competitors reflects that rival's actual view. The central research question is twofold: how does competitor acumen develop, and what are its market consequences? The study is theoretically framed within competitive dynamics and a social network 'embeddedness' perspective, arguing that a firm's position within a network of market-engagement relationships shapes its ability to accurately perceive its rivals. The core constructs studied are relational competitive embeddedness (direct market overlap with a rival), structural competitive embeddedness (sharing common third-party competitors with a rival), competitor acumen (perceptual accuracy), resource deployment capability, and relative market share gain. The research context is the U.S. airline industry in the early 1990s, using a combination of archival market data and perceptual survey data from senior executives. The main findings indicate that both relational and structural competitive embeddedness are positively associated with a firm's competitor acumen. Furthermore, higher competitor acumen leads to greater relative market share gains against that specific rival. A key conclusion is that competitor acumen acts as a moderator, enhancing the positive effect of a firm's resource deployment capability on its market performance. The paper's primary contribution is redirecting competitor analysis from a traditional firm-centric approach to a novel rival-centric perspective, providing a new, measurable cognitive construct that links a firm's network position to its competitive outcomes."
