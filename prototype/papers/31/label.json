    "L1_summary_of_paper": "This empirical paper extends the resource-based view (RBV) by incorporating capability weaknesses—defined comparatively to rivals—alongside strengths to explain temporary competitive advantage and relative performance. Using a comparative lens, the authors classify six capabilities (cost management, product reliability, product innovation, process innovation, brand management, manufacturing flexibility) as strengths, weaknesses, or parity relative to major competitors. They aggregate above-parity capabilities into a firm’s strength set and below-parity ones into a weakness set, and study (i) their direct effects on industry-centered value-added (relative performance), (ii) their integrative effects via four configurations (low/low, high/low, low/high, high/high), and (iii) how these sets change over time as a function of environmental munificence and prior performance. Theoretically, strength sets yield complementarities and differentiation advantages; weakness sets compound vulnerability, inefficiency, and foregone opportunities; and the high-strength/high-weakness configuration can create a precarious, high-variance advantage via selective investment. Empirically, strength sets show a positive curvilinear association with relative performance; weakness sets show a negative linear association; high strength/low weakness outperforms; low strength/high weakness underperforms; and high strength/high weakness performs positively but is theoretically more volatile. Over time, munificence reduces weakness sets (moving firms toward parity) while prior performance both increases strength sets and reduces weakness sets. The study contributes a multi-channel, comparative view of capability-based advantage and highlights the routine erosion and reconfiguration of advantages in rivalrous markets.",
