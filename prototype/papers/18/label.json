    "L1_summary_of_paper": "The paper asks whether rivals’ alliances increase or decrease the competitive pressure a focal firm experiences and whether firms can counter those effects by collaborating with those rivals. It distinguishes alliance types—horizontal (with competitors), upstream (with knowledge suppliers like universities), and downstream (with commercialization partners like pharma/marketing)—and develops a framework combining RBV/TCE logics of resource access/foreclosure with organizational ecology’s carrying capacity/legitimation logic. Constructs include rivals’ alliance counts by type, partners’ alliance counts, network efficiency, and focal firm exit (discrete‑time hazard). Context is Canadian biotechnology, 1991–1996; data come from the Canadian Biotechnology directory and U.S. patent records. Main findings: rivals’ alliances generally raise a focal firm’s exit risk, with the effect strongest for horizontal, weaker for upstream, and weakest/mostly null for downstream; partnering with well‑connected rivals reduces exit risk for most partner types; rivals’ network efficiency raises hazard; focal firms’ own alliances with pharma/chemical/university reduce hazard; patenting patterns have asymmetric effects (rivals’ recent/pending patents increase hazard, rivals’ older patents decrease it). Contributions: introduces alliance‑type contingent competitive effects via foreclosure vs. carrying capacity, bridges RBV/TCE with ecological competition models, and shifts attention from effects on participants to effects on rivals and group‑versus‑group dynamics in alliance networks.",
