      "L1_summary_of_paper": "This paper develops a formal model to investigate the research question: How does a firm's growth rate influence its ability to incentivize employees, and how does this interaction shape the firm's lifecycle dynamics? The key concepts are 'extra-role behaviors' (employee efforts beyond their job description, such as process innovation) and 'promotion-based incentives' (using the prospect of promotion as a reward). The theoretical framing integrates tournament theory with organizational economics (specifically two-sided moral hazard) and learning curve dynamics. The model examines the relationships between firm growth rate, promotion opportunities, the wage premium required for motivation, employee effort in process innovation, and the firm's production costs. The context is a stylized monopoly firm in a market with downward-sloping demand. The main finding is that this dynamic endogenously creates a three-stage firm lifecycle: 1) a high-growth phase where frequent promotions require only modest wage premiums to incentivize innovation; 2) a moderate-growth phase where slowing growth and fewer promotions necessitate large wage premiums to maintain incentives, which is viable due to the firm's large scale; and 3) a stagnant phase where growth is too low to make promotion-based incentives economically feasible, leading to a cessation of innovation. The paper's primary contribution is to bridge the literature on internal incentive design and external market dynamics, demonstrating that a firm's growth rate, distinct from its size, is a critical driver of its innovative capability and long-term trajectory. It provides an incentive-based explanation for why firms face a 'growth imperative'."
