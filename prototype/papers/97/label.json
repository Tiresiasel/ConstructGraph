      "L1_summary_of_paper": "This paper addresses a critical gap in the Awareness-Motivation-Capability (AMC) framework: how firms can predict which indirect competitors will become direct rivals. The central research question is how to make the 'awareness' construct in the AMC framework prescient and predictive, especially for cross-industry threats. The authors develop and test a multi-level 'hostility profile' composed of four 'awareness cues' to identify potential future competitors. Key concepts include firm-level diversification, dyad-level asymmetric pressure (the differential exposure to competitive pressure), and network-level convergence and degree of separation. The study is framed within competitive dynamics (CD) literature, arguing against a purely industry-based view of competition in favor of a more fluid 'arena' perspective. The core theoretical argument is that these four cues, when triangulated, can predict the likelihood of a competitive encounter forming between two firms. The study uses a large longitudinal dataset (2007-2016) from the Customer Experience Management (CEM) arena and employs Temporal Exponential Random Graph Models (TERGM) to analyze over 15 million dyad-year observations. The main findings strongly support the model: diversification, asymmetric pressure, and network convergence are all positively associated with the likelihood of competitive encounters. The most significant finding is the establishment of a clear boundary condition for awareness: the threat from indirect competitors becomes statistically insignificant beyond the third degree of separation (a rival's rival's rival). The paper's primary contributions are threefold: 1) it makes the 'awareness' construct predictive, 2) it provides a clear, empirically-grounded boundary for the scope of necessary awareness, and 3) it introduces a novel multi-level, network-centric methodology (TERGM) to the study of competitive dynamics."

By developing a 'hostility profile' based on four cues (diversification, asymmetric pressure, convergence, degree of separation), it provides scholars and managers with a new, empirically-validated way to 'see' and prioritize threats from indirect, cross-industry competitors. Methodologically, it introduces the Temporal Exponential Random Graph Model (TERGM) to the competitive dynamics literature, offering a powerful tool for analyzing interdependent and evolving competitive relationships."
