      "L1_summary_of_paper": "This conceptual paper addresses the research question of why firms compete vigorously in certain markets while ignoring others, even when economic incentives appear similar. It introduces a new key concept, the 'identity domain,' defined as the competitive arena that best demonstrates and reinforces an organization's identity and thus holds high psychological value for its top managers. The theoretical framing integrates organizational identity theory with the competitive dynamics literature, specifically proposing to provide a deeper theoretical grounding for the Awareness-Motivation-Capability (AMC) perspective. The central argument is that a firm's identity shapes an identity domain where managers exhibit heightened awareness of competitors, stronger motivation to act and react, and consequently develop superior capabilities. This leads firms to engage in more numerous, rapid, and diverse competitive actions within their identity domain, especially when it is threatened. However, this intense focus can also lead to negative consequences like managerial myopia towards threats outside the domain, overinvestment in the domain regardless of financial performance, and the development of an overly narrow set of capabilities. The model also proposes that a strong reputation in the identity domain can moderate this dynamic, substituting for overt action by deterring competitors. The paper's main contribution is bridging the gap between the internal, cognitive concept of identity and the external, behavioral phenomena of competitive dynamics, offering a psychological explanation for competitive actions that may appear irrational from a purely economic standpoint."
