    "L1_summary_of_paper": "This empirical-quantitative study examines how the competitive actions of industry leaders and second-place challengers influence market share erosion and the likelihood of dethronement, drawing on Austrian economics and competitive dynamics theory. Using a matched-pairs longitudinal dataset of 41 U.S. industries from 1987–1993 (287 leader–challenger pair-years), the authors define competitive action as a newly created, externally directed, observable market-based move that challenges the status quo. Four action characteristics are analyzed: (1) total competitive activity (number of new actions), (2) action timing (speed relative to rival), (3) action repertoire simplicity (breadth vs. narrowness of action types), and (4) leader–challenger action dissimilarity (differences in action types). Market share erosion is measured as the annual change in the logarithmic market share gap; dethronement is a binary event of leader turnover. Data on competitive actions are coded from 4,876 media-reported events into six categories (pricing, marketing/promotion, product introduction, capacity, legal, signaling). The study uses GLS regression for continuous erosion outcomes and Cox proportional hazards models for dethronement events, controlling for industry growth, concentration, barriers to entry, firm size, and prior dominance. Results show that leaders outperform challengers in maintaining market position when they take more total actions and act faster; slower timing increases erosion and dethronement risk. Leaders with simpler repertoires than challengers are marginally more vulnerable; action dissimilarity shows no significant effect. Findings support Austrian economics’ view that continuous, diverse, and rapid competitive action helps sustain leadership in hypercompetitive contexts, while complacency or narrow strategic focus accelerates decline. Contributions include integrating Austrian market process theory into competitive dynamics, operationalizing action-based measures across industries, and highlighting the importance of relative, dyadic action characteristics in predicting market share change.",
