      "L1_summary_of_paper": "This paper empirically investigates the widely held contention that markets have become increasingly 'hypercompetitive' in recent decades. The central research question is whether there is broad, systematic evidence to support claims of escalating market instability and a corresponding decline in the sustainability of competitive advantage. The study frames this as an adjudication between the 'hypercompetition' perspective (e.g., D'Aveni, 1994), which posits a fundamental shift towards inherent instability, and more traditional strategic management theories (IO, RBV) that rely on assumptions of relative stability for explaining performance differences. The core constructs examined are business performance stability and market stability, operationalized through four key metrics: the durability of abnormal business returns, business mortality rates, industry dynamism, and industry munificence. The study uses a large-scale, longitudinal dataset of publicly traded U.S. business units from the Compustat Industry Segment database, spanning the years 1978-1997. The main finding is a lack of support for the hypothesis of a continuous, linear increase in hypercompetition. Instead of a steady trend, the results reveal a cyclical pattern: instability increased from the late 1970s to the mid-to-late 1980s, but then decreased through the mid-1990s, returning to levels similar to the beginning of the period. The paper concludes that, contrary to popular belief, markets in the late 1990s were no more dynamic or challenging than they were in the late 1970s. Its primary contribution is to provide robust, large-scale empirical evidence that challenges a dominant narrative in strategy, suggesting that perceptions of ever-increasing turbulence may be a cognitive bias (hindsight bias) rather than an objective reality, and that traditional strategy principles focused on stable factors remain relevant."

It redirects the scholarly conversation from assuming hypercompetition as a given to questioning when and why periods of instability occur, while also reinforcing the enduring relevance of traditional strategy theories based on stable sources of advantage."
