      "L1_summary_of_paper": "This paper addresses the fragmentation in the literature on competitor identification, a core element of competitive dynamics. The central research question is how to organize and integrate the diverse theoretical and empirical research on this topic from management, marketing, and industrial organization (IO) economics. The key concepts are the various conceptualizations of competitor identification, which the authors synthesize into four distinct perspectives: industry-oriented, strategic groups-oriented, manager-oriented, and customer-oriented. The paper's theoretical framing is that of a systematic, integrative literature review. It reviews constructs such as market boundaries, strategic groups, managerial cognition (cognitive maps), and customer perceptions as bases for identifying competitors. The main finding is that these four perspectives are not mutually exclusive but are complementary, each offering partial insights. They can be organized along two dimensions: the focus of analysis (products/markets vs. firms) and the basis for identification (objective characteristics vs. subjective perceptions). The paper's primary contribution is twofold: first, it provides the first comprehensive, integrated framework that organizes this disparate body of literature, clarifying the assumptions and contributions of each perspective. Second, it proposes a detailed and forward-looking research agenda organized into six themes (dynamics, interorganizational relations, micro-foundations, practice/process, international dimensions, and entrepreneurial contexts) to guide future scholarly work."
