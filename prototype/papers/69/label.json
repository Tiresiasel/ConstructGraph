      "L1_summary_of_paper": "This conceptual paper addresses the research question of how to bridge the gap between competitor analysis and the prediction of interfirm rivalry. It introduces and defines two key firm-specific constructs: 'market commonality' (the degree of a competitor's presence in markets shared with a focal firm, weighted by strategic importance) and 'resource similarity' (the extent to which a competitor possesses comparable strategic endowments in type and amount). The theoretical framing integrates the 'outside-in' perspective of multipoint competition literature with the 'inside-out' perspective of the resource-based view (RBV), arguing they are complementary. The paper proposes a series of relationships: market commonality primarily drives a firm's awareness and motivation to attack or respond, while resource similarity primarily drives its capability. A key argument is the existence of 'competitive asymmetry,' where Firm A's view of Firm B as a competitor may not equal Firm B's view of Firm A. The paper uses the U.S. airline industry as an illustrative context to propose measurement methods for the constructs. Its main conclusions are presented as a series of propositions, such as high market commonality and high resource similarity both decrease the likelihood of attack but increase the likelihood of response. The paper's primary contribution is providing a new, dyad-level theoretical framework that allows for a more granular, predictive analysis of competitive behavior than existing industry- or strategic group-level approaches."
