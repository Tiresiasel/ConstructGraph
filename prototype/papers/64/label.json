      "L1_summary_of_paper": "This paper investigates how the configuration of a firm's alliance portfolio influences its competitive action frequency. It challenges research that examines portfolio attributes in isolation by proposing a configurational model where synergy among attributes is paramount. The theoretical framework integrates competitive dynamics, social network theory, and entrepreneurial opportunity research. It argues that a high frequency of competitive action requires three distinct capabilities, each supported by a specific portfolio attribute: 1) opportunity recognition capacity, enabled by the diverse information from portfolios rich in structural holes; 2) opportunity development capacity, enabled by the broad knowledge base from a wide R&D alliance scope; and 3) action execution capacity, enabled by the reliable and trustworthy partners in portfolios with a high proportion of equity alliances. The central thesis is that these three attributes have a multiplicative, synergistic effect on competitive action frequency. Using a panel dataset of 12 global automobile manufacturers from 1988 to 2003, the study finds strong support for a positive three-way interaction among structural holes, R&D alliance scope, and equity alliances. This effect is significantly stronger for complex strategic actions (e.g., new products, product improvements) than for simpler tactical actions (e.g., pricing). The study's main contribution is to advance competitive dynamics research by introducing alliance portfolio configuration as a key antecedent of competitive aggressiveness, thereby demonstrating that it is the holistic combination of network attributes, rather than any single attribute, that drives a firm's ability to compete actively."
