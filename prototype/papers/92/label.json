      "L1_summary_of_paper": "This study investigates the conditions under which relational embeddedness, typically a source of stability, can paradoxically increase the likelihood of a client relationship dissolving following a merger or acquisition (M&A). The core research question is how increases in competitive overlap among a firm's clients, triggered by an M&A, interact with the existing level of relational embeddedness to affect client retention. The key concepts are 'relational embeddedness' (the history and trust in a dyadic relationship, proxied by duration) and 'competitive overlap' (the extent to which a firm's clients compete with each other). The study is framed by network dynamics and exchange theory, challenging the uniformly positive view of embeddedness. It examines the relationship between embeddedness, changes in competitive overlap, and their interaction on the outcome of client relationship dissolution. The context is the advertising industry, using archival data on 10 M&A events in 2000 and tracking the subsequent survival of 2,167 client relationships over three years. The main finding is a significant interaction effect: while embeddedness generally reduces dissolution likelihood, at high levels of post-merger competitive overlap, greater embeddedness *increases* the likelihood of dissolution. The study explains this through mechanisms of perceived trust betrayal and heightened fears of sensitive information leakage. The primary contribution is to the theory of relationship dissolution and network dynamics by demonstrating that the stabilizing effects of embeddedness are contingent on the broader network structure, and that under specific conditions of competitive friction, the very sources of relational strength can become liabilities."

By showing that embeddedness can become a liability under conditions of high competitive friction—due to heightened risks of information leakage and trust betrayal—the study provides a novel, endogenous explanation for the evolution of inter-organizational networks."
