    "L1_summary_of_paper": "The paper examines how local agglomeration (geographic co-location) interacts with hotels’ strategic orientations (price–quality segments from economy to luxury) to shape performance in the U.S. lodging industry. It asks whether clusters with more highly differentiated (high-end) properties raise neighbors’ demand-based performance, whether clusters dense in low-cost properties depress luxury performance, and whether a hotel’s strategic distance from the local cluster norm amplifies these effects. Framing integrates agglomeration economics (local externalities) with differentiation strategy, focusing on demand-side spillovers in services. Constructs include strategic orientation (five segments), cluster composition (segment shares within census tracts), strategic distance (absolute gap between a hotel’s segment and the tract’s mean segment), and performance (RevPAR). Using a large cross-section (≈15k hotels, year 2000) and FGLS models estimated within segment with rich location and structure controls, the study finds: (1) for economy, midscale (with/without F&B), and upscale hotels, a higher local share of more-differentiated properties is associated with higher RevPAR; (2) for luxury hotels, a higher local share of lower-cost properties is associated with lower RevPAR; (3) strategic distance amplifies these effects—positive for lower-cost hotels in high-end clusters and negative for high-end hotels in low-end clusters. Contributions: recasts agglomeration in services as a redistributive demand mechanism conditional on strategy; introduces strategic distance as a moderator; bridges competitive dynamics with urban/agglomeration literatures.",
