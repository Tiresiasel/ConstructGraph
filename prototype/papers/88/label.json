    "L1_summary_of_paper": "This paper investigates how incumbent firms' market positions and the interdependencies across their submarkets shape their strategic responses to entry threats. The central research question is how and why incumbents with different market positions (premium vs. low-cost) react differently to the threat of entry from a low-cost competitor. The study's key concepts are market position (defined by demand functions and operating costs), submarket interdependencies (within-market substitutability and between-market complementarity), and strategic response (capacity expansion, pricing, quality). Theoretically, the paper integrates and extends classical industrial organization models of entry deterrence with the strategic management literature on market positioning. It formally models the trade-offs between ignoring, deterring, and accommodating entry, predicting that premium incumbents have a stronger incentive to deter low-cost entry than low-cost incumbents do, especially when capacity investment costs are low. This incentive is moderated by submarket characteristics. The study context is the U.S. airline industry from 2003 to 2012, examining the capacity, price, and quality responses of incumbent full-service carriers (FSCs) and low-cost carriers (LCCs) to the threat of entry by Southwest Airlines. The main findings are that: (1) FSCs (premium) responded to threats by significantly expanding capacity, while LCCs (low-cost) did not; (2) FSCs' capacity expansion was less aggressive on routes with lower customer substitutability (i.e., more business travelers) and routes with higher complementarity to their existing network (i.e., routes connecting to their international hubs). The paper's primary contribution is to connect the literatures on entry deterrence and market positions, providing a nuanced mechanism for 'positional immutability'â€”showing that past choices about products and costs create incentives for a tough defense, while choices about submarket interdependencies create barriers to imitation."
