    "L1_summary_of_paper": "This empirical study tests how timing of entry into a newly emergent technical subfield affects firm performance, using the ATM subfield in U.S. banking (1971–1979). Grounded in population ecology, the paper argues that early entry into a high-magnitude, voluntary change can improve performance, but the effect is conditional on competitive density at the industry and subfield levels and on the imitability of entry (e.g., mandated ATM network sharing). Using a large panel of >3,500 banks (entrants and non-entrants), the authors estimate models that control for unobserved heterogeneity. Main findings: early entry is associated with higher ROA and net income; advantages weaken or reverse when macro or subfield density is high or when entry is highly imitable; niche width (specialist vs generalist) does not significantly moderate. Contributions include extending ecological density-dependence and imitability logic to a service innovation context, demonstrating performance consequences of subfield entry with a panel including non-entrants, and delineating boundary conditions for first-mover advantages.",
