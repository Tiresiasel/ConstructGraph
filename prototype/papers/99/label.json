      "L1_summary_of_paper": "This study investigates how organizations manage the dual challenge of changing their identity while maintaining distinctiveness, particularly when institutional identity anchors (like political ideologies) weaken. The central research question is: How do political parties maintain their identity distinctiveness while seeking identity change in an environment of simultaneous repositioning by competitors? The key concepts are 'identity affirmation' (defending core identity elements against competitor encroachment) and 'identity reformation' (cautiously expanding into new elements guided by competitor actions and identity coherence). The theoretical framing integrates organizational identity theory, which emphasizes continuity and internal consistency, with competitive rivalry theory, which highlights inter-organizational threat and imitation. The study examines the relationship between competitor claims on political issues (construct: competitor investment) and a focal party's own issue selection and investment level. The context is the British political system from 1970 to 1992, using coded election manifestos from the Conservative, Labour, and Liberal parties. The main findings show that parties (1) engage in identity affirmation by counter-investing heavily in their core identity issues when those issues are challenged by rivals, and (2) engage in identity reformation by imitating rivals to select new issues but constraining their investment based on the issue's ideological proximity (investing most in neutral, then adjacent, and least in oppositional issues). The paper's main contribution is to reconceptualize identity change as an interactive, emergent process shaped by competitive dynamics, thereby bridging the internal (micro) and external (macro) views within organizational identity literature and enriching theories of political competition."

It reframes identity change not as an isolated, internal process but as an interactive, inter-organizational dynamic where firms simultaneously defend their core identity turf ('affirmation') while cautiously exploring new identity spaces guided by competitor signals and constrained by coherence concerns ('reformation'). This provides a more realistic model of how organizations manage the inherent tension between identity change and distinctiveness in a competitive environment."
