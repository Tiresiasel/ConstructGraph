    "L1_summary_of_paper": "This empirical-quantitative SMJ study asks how executives’ temporal depth—how far back they look into the past (PTD) and how far ahead they look into the future (FTD)—interacts with industry velocity to shape firms’ competitive aggressiveness and, in turn, performance. Grounded in upper echelons, competitive dynamics, contingency, and entrainment perspectives, the paper theorizes that executive temporal orientation is a third temporal force complementing macro (industry) and micro (firm action) tempos. Using a 1995–2000 U.S. panel of 258 single-business firms across 23 industries, the authors code PTD/FTD from executive communications and operationalize competitive aggressiveness as the composite of action volume and (inverse) action speed from LexisNexis-coded market actions; industry velocity is the average action rate of dominant firms (>80% share) in each industry-year. They find: (i) PTD raises aggressiveness in low-velocity industries but lowers it in high-velocity industries; (ii) FTD raises aggressiveness in low-velocity industries but follows an inverted-U in high-velocity industries; and (iii) aggressiveness improves performance, more so when velocity is high. Contributions: integrating subjective temporal orientation into competitive dynamics; specifying velocity-contingent fit of PTD/FTD; and linking aggressiveness to performance under temporal contingencies. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}",
