      "L1_summary_of_paper": "This study investigates the relationship between multimarket contact (MMC) and service quality, proposing that the logic of mutual forbearance extends beyond price competition to non-price dimensions. The core research question is whether firms that compete against each other in multiple markets compete less aggressively on service quality. The key concept of multimarket contact refers to the extent to which firms meet the same rivals in multiple markets. The study's primary theoretical framing is the mutual forbearance hypothesis, which posits that the threat of retaliation across a broad portfolio of shared markets deters aggressive competitive actions. The central relationship examined is the effect of a carrier's MMC on a specific route on its service quality, measured by on-time performance. The context is the U.S. airline industry from January 1995 to August 2001, using a large dataset of domestic flights. The main finding is that increased MMC is associated with worse on-time performance (i.e., increased delays), suggesting tacit collusion on quality. This effect is primarily driven by increased time spent on the ground before departure. Furthermore, the study finds that this negative effect is strongest when the contact occurs in markets with intermediate levels of concentration, rather than the most or least concentrated markets. The paper's primary contribution is extending the mutual forbearance hypothesis to service quality, providing a new mechanism to explain the positive relationship between MMC and profitability, and deepening the understanding of how market structure influences non-price competition."
