      "L1_summary_of_paper": "This paper investigates how asymmetries in territorial interests among multimarket competitors affect rivalry and the sustainability of market positions. The core research question is whether firms can use footholds in their rivals' important markets as a deterrent to protect their own core territories, or 'spheres of influence'. The study extends multimarket competition theory and the mutual forbearance hypothesis by incorporating the concept of spheres of influence (Edwards, 1964) and insights from game theory, challenging purely resource-based or structural views of sustainability by focusing on influencing rivals' *motivation* to attack. The central constructs are reciprocal multimarket contact (where a firm has a foothold in a rival's important market) versus nonreciprocal contact. The study hypothesizes that reciprocal contact is more effective at reducing competitive intensity (measured by price/yield) and sustaining a leader's market share. The context is the U.S. scheduled airline industry from 1984-1988, with city-pairs as markets. The main findings show strong support that reciprocal contact leads to less intense price competition from both challengers and leaders. The effect on market share sustainability is contingent on how 'spheres of influence' are defined, with the strongest effect found when defined by resource centrality (i.e., airport hubs). The paper's primary contribution is refining multimarket theory by showing that the strategic nature, not just the quantity, of market contacts matters, and it bridges competitive dynamics with the resource-based view by demonstrating how strategic deterrence can protect valuable resource commitments."

It moves beyond simply counting market overlaps to demonstrate that the strategic nature of these overlaps is what truly matters. By empirically testing the 'spheres of influence' hypothesis, it shows that credible, reciprocal threats in rivals' core territories are a powerful mechanism for deterring aggression, facilitating tacit collusion, and ultimately sustaining a firm's dominant position in its own core markets. It provides a crucial bridge between the resource-based view and competitive dynamics by showing how firms can actively use strategic deterrence to protect their valuable resource commitments."
