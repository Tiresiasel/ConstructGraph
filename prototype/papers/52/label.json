      "L1_summary_of_paper": "This study investigates the drivers of competitive response, specifically focusing on why some competitive moves are not met with a response or why responses are delayed. The core research question is: What factors determine the likelihood, speed, and nature of a firm's response to a competitor's action? The paper develops a theoretical framework grounded in game theory under incomplete information. It introduces two key concepts: 'competitor dependence,' defined as a defending firm's reliance on the market under attack, which serves as a proxy for the payoffs at stake; and 'action irreversibility,' defined as the cost and difficulty for an attacking firm to reverse its move, which acts as a credible signal of its commitment. The study analyzes the relationships between these constructs and three dimensions of response: the likelihood of nonresponse, the delay of response, and the likelihood of a matching response. The research context is the U.S. domestic airline industry from 1979 to 1986, a period of intense competition following deregulation. Using a unique dataset of 856 competitive actions and 203 responses identified from archival sources, combined with survey data from industry experts to measure irreversibility, the study employs logistic and OLS regression. Main findings indicate that higher competitor dependence significantly decreases the likelihood of nonresponse and increases the likelihood of a matching response. Higher action irreversibility increases the likelihood of nonresponse and the delay of response. Crucially, a significant interaction effect exists: when a highly irreversible (high commitment) attack targets a market where the defender has high dependence (high stakes), the response is swifter, reversing the main effect of irreversibility, likely to defend the firm's reputation. The study's main contribution is to provide one of the first large-scale, micro-level empirical tests of foundational concepts in competitive strategy (like commitment and signaling), shifting the unit of analysis to the action-response dyad and bringing systematic attention to the strategically important phenomenon of nonresponse."
