    "L1_summary_of_paper": "This paper investigates how resource-disadvantaged complementor firms can achieve ecosystem leadership. The central research question is: \"How does a resource-disadvantaged complementor architect ecosystem leadership?\" The study employs a longitudinal, qualitative case study of Xiaomi's evolution within the Android ecosystem from 2010 to 2019. Theoretically, the paper integrates the supply-side perspective of strategy (e.g., Resource-Based View) with the demand-side perspective, which emphasizes customer-facing value creation. Key concepts defined include 'complementors' (firms providing complementary offerings directly to mutual customers), 'foothold resource' (a mundane product used to start an identity movement), and 'derivative ecosystem' (an ecosystem created by a complementor around its own products, while remaining in the primary ecosystem). The study finds that Xiaomi followed a three-phase process to gain architectural control. **Phase I:** Building a demand-side community by crafting an 'emancipatory vision' around a foothold resource (the MIUI software) to engage underserved users. **Phase II:** Building supply-side legitimacy by crafting a 'pioneering vision' that used the demand-side community as material and social proof to persuade critical supply-side partners (like Qualcomm and Foxconn) to collaborate. **Phase III:** Creating a derivative ecosystem by crafting an 'orchestrator vision', incubating a community of fledgling firms to develop complementary hardware, and combining demand- and supply-side synergies to become a focal player. The paper's primary contributions are: 1) It offers a process model that integrates demand-side mobilization with supply-side orchestration for value creation by resource-lacking firms. 2) It explains how peripheral firms can gain power and centrality in an ecosystem by using their user community as leverage and crafting compelling, evolving visions substantiated by concrete actions. 3) It extends the structural view of ecosystems with a sociological explanation of how firms can transform ecosystem structures through a mutualistic, rather than purely disruptive, approach."

It advances ecosystem theory by providing a sociological account of how firms can proactively change their structural position through evolving visions and a mutualistic approach, rather than through pure disruption."
