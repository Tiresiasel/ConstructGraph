      "L1_summary_of_paper": "This study investigates how different types of shareholder activists differentially affect the strategic actions of targeted firms. The core research question is: How do firms alter their strategic actions when targeted by hedge fund activists versus corporate shareholder activists? The paper defines 'strategic actions' as long-run competitive moves requiring substantial investment, such as acquisitions, partnerships, and new product introductions. It measures these actions along two dimensions: 'intensity' (the number of actions) and 'complexity' (the diversity and novelty of actions). The theoretical framework contrasts two activist types based on their objectives and investment horizons. Hedge fund activism is framed through 'threat rigidity theory,' arguing that the short-term, financially-driven pressure from hedge funds is perceived as a threat by managers, leading them to conserve resources, reduce uncertainty, and consequently decrease the intensity and complexity of strategic actions. In contrast, corporate shareholder activism is framed as an 'opportunity,' where a non-financial corporation invests for long-term strategic synergies. This provides the target firm with new resources (capital, knowledge, networks) and extends managerial discretion, thereby increasing the intensity and complexity of its strategic actions. The study uses a matched sample difference-in-differences (DID) methodology on a sample of U.S. public firms from 2004-2017. The main findings strongly support the theory: firms targeted by hedge fund activists significantly decrease both the intensity and complexity of their strategic actions, while firms targeted by corporate shareholder activists significantly increase both. The paper's primary contribution is to the shareholder governance and competitive dynamics literature by demonstrating the critical importance of disaggregating activist types, showing they are not a monolithic group and can have diametrically opposed effects on corporate strategy."

This finding refines shareholder governance theory and extends competitive dynamics research by identifying activist type as a critical contingent factor shaping a firm's competitive behavior."
