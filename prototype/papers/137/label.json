      "L1_summary_of_paper": "This paper investigates the competitive positioning strategies of management consulting firms by analyzing their use of service marks. The core research question is how firms manage the tension between positioning near competitors—to gain legitimacy, reduce uncertainty, and benefit from spillovers—and positioning far from them to achieve differentiation and reduce direct competition. The study integrates theories of competitive strategy, institutional theory, and spillover effects, proposing a 'balance perspective' where firms simultaneously seek proximity on some dimensions and distance on others. The analysis is conducted at the dyadic level, considering the asymmetric relationship between a 'focal' firm and an 'other' firm. Using a dataset of service mark filings from the 50 largest consulting firms between 1972 and 1999, the study examines how the dyadic distance between services is influenced by firm similarity, age, size, and the use of prospective service filings (Intent-to-Use marks). Key findings indicate that positioning is indeed a multidimensional and dyadic balancing act. For instance, firms position their overall competitive posture far from similar firms but place individual service marks near similar marks. Younger firms position near others, while older firms position far away; however, firms are generally drawn to position near older, more established rivals. The study's main contributions are introducing a dyadic, asymmetric lens to positioning research, extending the field to intangible professional services, and demonstrating the value of service marks as a data source for strategic analysis."
