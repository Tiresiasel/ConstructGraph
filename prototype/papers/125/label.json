      "L1_summary_of_paper": "This paper investigates an indirect consequence of institutional investor activism, termed 'portfolio spillover.' The core research question is how activist behavior targeted at one firm within an investor's portfolio influences the strategic actions of other, non-targeted firms held by the same investor. The key concept is the 'implicit threat' that non-targeted firms perceive when they observe their activist shareholder taking action elsewhere. To explain this phenomenon, the study extends the Awareness-Motivation-Capability (AMC) framework, traditionally used in competitive dynamics, to the corporate governance arena. The primary constructs studied are activist investor ownership (as a proxy for awareness of the implicit threat), and the firm's subsequent corporate restructuring and growth activities (as responses). The study uses a large panel dataset of S&P 1500 companies from 2000 to 2013. The main findings are that higher ownership by activist investors is positively associated with a non-targeted firm's restructuring activities and negatively associated with its growth activities. These relationships are stronger when firms have weak constitutional constraints against shareholder control (moderating firm motivation) and when transactional investor ownership is high (moderating activist capability). A quasi-natural experiment using activist fund closures supports a causal interpretation. The paper's primary contributions are twofold: it successfully extends the theoretical scope of the AMC framework beyond interfirm competition to governance, and it identifies and provides evidence for portfolio spillover as a significant, previously under-theorized externality of shareholder activism, highlighting that activism's influence is much broader than its direct targets."

In doing so, it makes a major theoretical contribution by demonstrating the applicability of the Awareness-Motivation-Capability (AMC) framework outside its traditional domain of competitive dynamics, successfully redirecting it to explain corporate governance phenomena. This work reveals a crucial, and potentially negative, externality of activism, suggesting its full economic impact is far broader and more complex than previously understood."
