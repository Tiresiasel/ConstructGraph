      "L1_summary_of_paper": "This paper develops a game-theoretic model to investigate how duopolistic platform firms strategically choose their preannouncement strategy for new platform versions in a two-sided market. The core research question is how market conditions, specifically the strength of agents' taste preferences, influence a firm's decision on the level of information to disclose about new network effect-engendering (NEE) features. The study conceptualizes three distinct strategies: formal (full information), informal (partial information), and no-preannouncement. Using a Hotelling model of spatial competition, the paper analyzes the trade-off between preannouncement's benefits (increasing expected network effects for users and developers) and its costs (intensifying price competition and incurring direct marketing expenses). The main finding is that the optimal equilibrium strategy is systematically determined by the strength of agents' taste preferences (a proxy for market differentiation). In markets with weak preferences (low differentiation), firms opt for a no-preannouncement strategy to soften price competition. In markets with strong preferences (high differentiation), firms are compelled to pursue a formal preannouncement to offset the high disutility agents face from a non-ideal platform, thus ensuring participation. The study also explores extensions, finding that the ability of an installed base to switch platforms increases competitive intensity and favors less information disclosure, while the ability of developers to multihome is beneficial for firm profits, consumer welfare, and social welfare. The paper's primary contribution is to endogenize information disclosure as a strategic lever in platform competition, moving beyond prior work that treated information as an exogenous market condition."
