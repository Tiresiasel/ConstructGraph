    "L1_summary_of_paper": "This paper examines how organizational form, function, and competitive advantage coevolve in hypercompetitive environments, using an inductive case study of Yahoo! and Excite from 1994 to 1999. It introduces the concept of 'continuous morphing,' defined as comprehensive and ongoing transformations in products, services, resources, capabilities, and organizational structures to regenerate transient competitive advantage. The authors draw from dynamic capabilities and strategic flexibility theory, showing how the two firms transformed from search engines to destination sites to web portals, each time reconfiguring organizational arrangements to align with shifting competitive and market conditions. Yahoo!'s approach emphasized internal capability leveraging, emergent learning routines, simple organizing principles, and stable top management, whereas Excite relied more on acquisitions and external assets, often depleting resources. The study develops propositions linking continuous morphing to dynamic capabilities, strategic flexibility, competitive migration, and transient advantage, arguing that in high-velocity markets, advantage rests more on the process of ongoing renewal than on static positioning or resource bundles. Contributions include extending organizational form theory to dynamic contexts, integrating it with dynamic capabilities and strategic flexibility, and offering a framework for understanding competitive advantage regeneration under hypercompetition.",
