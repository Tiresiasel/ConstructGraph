      "L1_summary_of_paper": "This study investigates how different types of interorganizational linkages affect the occurrence and cross-market spillover of competitive wars. The key concepts are 'competitive wars' (severe, destructive, and unsustainable competitive interactions, distinct from day-to-day competition), 'interorganizational linkages' (differentiated into direct ties like strategic alliances and indirect ties like common ownership and common analyst coverage), and 'spillover' (the spread of war from one market to another). The paper is framed by the social embeddedness perspective, which it uses to propose a 'glue versus gasoline' metaphor. The central argument is that while both direct and indirect linkages act as 'glue' to reduce the likelihood of a war occurring initially, their roles diverge dramatically once a war has started elsewhere. The study analyzes the U.S. domestic airline industry from 1991 to 2010. The main findings are: (1) Strategic alliances, common ownership, and common analyst ties all significantly decrease the probability of a competitive war starting in a market. (2) The presence of incumbents at war in other markets significantly increases the probability of a war spilling over into a focal market. (3) In the context of a potential spillover, direct linkages (strategic alliances) transform into 'gasoline,' amplifying the spillover effect. (4) Conversely, indirect linkages (common ownership and common analyst ties) function as even stronger 'glue,' attenuating the spillover effect. The paper's primary contributions are to the competitive dynamics literature by studying the under-examined phenomenon of competitive wars, to the social embeddedness literature by demonstrating the context-dependent and divergent effects of direct versus indirect ties, and to the multimarket competition literature by empirically testing the spillover assumption."

This provides a nuanced understanding of the social embeddedness of competition, highlighting the critical mechanistic differences between direct and indirect ties and their divergent effects during conflict escalation."
