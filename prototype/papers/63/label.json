      "L1_summary_of_paper": "This conceptual paper addresses the question of why and how strategic leaders envision different types of business ecosystems, particularly in the context of digital transformation. It develops a novel 'motivated interactional lens' to explain this variation. The core theoretical argument is that a leader's fundamental cognitive motivations—defined by two orthogonal dimensions, the 'need for diversity' (seeking information from a wide vs. narrow range of sources) and the 'need for openness' (the desire to avoid premature cognitive closure)—jointly determine the type of social interactions they engage in with potential partners. The paper theorizes four distinct interaction types: participatory, selective, collaborative, and reclusive. These interaction types, in turn, are proposed to shape the leader's ecosystem vision, which is conceptualized as a mental model of multilateral complementarities. The mechanism linking interaction to vision is the change in the structure of the leader's mental model, specifically its levels of differentiation (variety of concepts) and integration (connections between concepts). For example, a collaborative interaction (driven by high needs for both diversity and openness) is proposed to increase both differentiation and integration, leading to the envisioning of complex 'supermodular complementarities'. Conversely, a reclusive interaction (driven by low needs on both dimensions) is expected to result in little or no change to the envisioned ecosystem. The paper's main contribution is providing a cognitive, micro-foundational theory of ecosystem vision formation, linking individual psychological drivers to firm-level strategic outcomes and offering a new perspective on strategic leadership in digital ecosystems."
