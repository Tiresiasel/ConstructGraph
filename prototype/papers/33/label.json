    "L1_summary_of_paper": "This conceptual article develops a multilevel structural embeddedness perspective to explain how cooperative interfirm networks shape competitive action and response. The core question is how the structural properties of a network of cooperative ties among competitors influence (i) the likelihood that a firm initiates a competitive action and (ii) the likelihood that targeted competitors respond. The authors define three types of network resource flows—assets, information, and status—that create asymmetries in motivation and capability. They identify four structural properties: firm-level centrality and structural autonomy (structural holes), dyad-level structural equivalence, and network-level density. The model proposes that centrality and structural autonomy increase action likelihood and decrease rivals’ response likelihood; structural equivalence decreases action likelihood but increases response likelihood; density decreases action likelihood but increases response likelihood. Network density also moderates the other effects, dampening centrality, strengthening structural autonomy, and weakening structural equivalence. Contributions include integrating structural embeddedness into competitive dynamics, offering a multilevel model across firm, dyad, and network levels, and specifying empirically testable propositions.",
