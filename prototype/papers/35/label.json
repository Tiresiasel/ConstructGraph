    "L1_summary_of_paper": "This empirical study investigates how firms in business groups in emerging economies acquire R&D capabilities through multiplex intragroup network ties. The authors propose a contingency model explaining how three types of ties—buyer-supplier, equity, and director ties—individually and in combination affect R&D capability acquisition, and how these effects are moderated by network density. The theoretical framing integrates the resource-based view and social network theory, emphasizing tie content and structural context. Buyer-supplier ties are argued to provide specific technological knowledge; director ties provide generic knowledge and strategic information; equity ties supply financial capital. Hypotheses predict that buyer-supplier centrality will positively relate to R&D capability, that director and equity centrality will each strengthen this effect, and that high centrality in all three ties will yield the largest gains. Director network density is expected to strengthen the buyer-supplier effect, whereas equity network density is expected to weaken it. The study uses data on 188 listed affiliates in 123 Taiwanese business groups from 1981–1998, measuring R&D capability via stochastic frontier estimation. Results from GLS random-effects models support most hypotheses. The paper contributes by highlighting multiplexity and structural contingency in network-based capability acquisition and by introducing stochastic frontier estimation to capability measurement.",
