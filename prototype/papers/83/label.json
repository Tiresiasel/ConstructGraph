    "L1_summary_of_paper": "This paper empirically investigates the temporal dimension of the relationship between different types of resource management actions and firm performance. It integrates the competitive dynamics literature with the resource management literature to identify four distinct types of actions: (1) structuring actions (acquiring, divesting resources), (2) bundling actions (integrating resources internally), (3) leveraging actions in product markets (e.g., pricing, marketing), and (4) leveraging actions in the regulatory arena (e.g., lobbying). The central research question is how these four action types differ in their temporal effects on performance, specifically concerning: (a) the time to positive performance impact (speed), (b) the persistence of this positive impact, and (c) the total impact on performance over time. The study uses a panel dataset of the 9 largest U.S. airlines from 1997 to 2004, analyzing quarterly data with a distributed time lag model and firm fixed effects. The main findings reveal significant trade-offs: leveraging actions in product markets have the fastest positive impact (1 quarter) but their total impact is not significant and turns negative in the long term. In contrast, bundling actions have the largest and most persistent positive impact, but take longer to materialize (3 quarters). Leveraging actions in the regulatory arena also have a significant positive total impact, materializing in the medium-to-long term (6 quarters). Structuring actions are the slowest to show a positive effect and have no significant total impact over the observation period. The paper's primary contribution is to introduce and empirically demonstrate the importance of the temporal dimension in strategic management, showing that the value of strategic actions is contingent on the time horizon over which they are evaluated, thus challenging short-term performance perspectives and adding a crucial dynamic element to the Resource-Based View (RBV)."
