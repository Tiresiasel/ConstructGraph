      "L1_summary_of_paper": "This theoretical paper addresses the research question of why tacit collusion appears more frequently in price (Bertrand) competition than in quantity (Cournot) competition, even without communication or repeated interaction. The authors develop and formalize a new cognitive theory called 'virtual bargaining.' The key concept is that decision-makers mentally simulate potential agreements by considering two scenarios for their counterpart's behavior: (1) the counterpart adheres to the agreement, or (2) the counterpart defects by playing a best response. The decision-maker then evaluates the agreement based on the lower of the two resulting payoffs, termed the 'worst payoff.' The set of all agreements that are stable against unilateral deviations (in terms of worst payoffs) are called 'feasible agreements.' From this set, a 'virtual bargaining equilibrium' (VBE) is selected using the Nash bargaining solution, where the status quo is the worst possible outcome among all feasible agreements. The paper applies this framework to standard duopoly models. The main finding is that the strategic structure of competition is critical. In Cournot competition (strategic substitutes), the VBE coincides with the non-collusive Nash equilibrium because any attempt to collude by reducing quantity is met with a punishing best response (increasing quantity) from the rival. In Bertrand competition (strategic complements), the VBE results in 'partial collusion,' where prices are set above the Nash equilibrium but below the fully collusive level. This occurs because a rival's best response to a price increase is also a price increase, making collusion less risky. The paper's primary contribution is providing a novel, static, cognitive-based mechanism for tacit collusion that explains the Bertrand paradox without relying on dynamic considerations like rewards and punishments, offering significant implications for antitrust policy."
