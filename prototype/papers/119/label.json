      "L1_summary_of_paper": "This paper investigates the spillover effects on non-accused firms when an industry peer is accused of financial misconduct. It aims to reconcile two conflicting theoretical perspectives: the 'stigma effect,' which predicts negative consequences for all industry peers due to generalized perceptions of risk, and the 'competition effect,' which predicts positive outcomes for rivals that can gain from the accused firm's weakened competitive position. The core theoretical argument is that both effects coexist, and their net impact is contingent on the degree of product market overlap between the non-accused firm and its accused peer. The study hypothesizes a U-shaped relationship: at low to moderate levels of overlap, the negative stigma effect dominates, but at very high levels of overlap, the positive competition effect begins to counterbalance and eventually outweighs the stigma. This relationship is further moderated by two key factors: the granularity of the market classification system used by observers, and the sophistication of investors. A more fine-grained classification and higher investor sophistication are predicted to make the competition effect more salient relative to the stigma effect. Using an event study methodology on data from the U.S. software industry (1991-2001), the research finds strong support for its hypotheses. The results show the predicted U-shaped effect of market overlap on the stock market returns of non-accused firms. Furthermore, this U-shape 'tilts' to favor the competition effect when a more fine-grained product classification is used. Finally, the study shows that more sophisticated investors (hedge funds and mutual funds) are more likely than their less sophisticated counterparts to increase their shareholdings in the accused firm's close competitors, especially as market overlap increases. The paper's main contribution is to provide a unified framework that adjudicates between the stigma and competition perspectives, explaining the significant heterogeneity in spillover effects by highlighting the dual role of market overlap as both a basis for cognitive generalization (stigma) and a landscape for competitive interaction (competition)."
