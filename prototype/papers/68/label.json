      "L1_summary_of_paper": "This paper investigates how incumbent firms strategically use vague language in their corporate communications to deter market entry by competitors. The core research questions are: (1) Under what competitive conditions do incumbents increase their use of vague language? and (2) How does this linguistic vagueness affect the market entry decisions of potential entrants? The study is theoretically framed within competitive dynamics, particularly its information-processing perspective, and strategic communication. It challenges the traditional competitive signaling view that emphasizes clarity and aggression, proposing vagueness as an alternative tool for creating interpretation difficulties. Key constructs include communication vagueness (the independent variable in the second stage), market entry likelihood (the dependent variable), and antecedents of vagueness like market profitability and the number of potential entrants. The study is set in the U.S. domestic airline industry from 1995 to 2001. Using computerized content analysis on firm annual reports (10-Ks) and survival analysis models, the main findings are: (a) Incumbents use more vague language in more profitable markets and in markets with more potential entrants, supporting the idea that vagueness is a response to perceived entry threats. (b) An incumbent's use of vague language is negatively associated with the likelihood of market entry by potential competitors. (c) This deterrent effect is stronger in markets with larger incumbents and higher market concentration, suggesting that vagueness is most effective when rivals are already paying close attention. The paper's primary contribution is to the competitive dynamics literature by distinguishing between 'awareness' (noticing) and 'interpretation' and demonstrating empirically that hindering interpretation is a viable competitive strategy. It also contributes to the literature on strategic language use by applying it to the context of interfirm rivalry."

By showing that ambiguity can be as powerful as aggression, it provides a more nuanced understanding of strategic communication in multi-stakeholder environments and challenges the prevailing wisdom in competitive signaling theory."
