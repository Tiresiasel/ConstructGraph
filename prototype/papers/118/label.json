      "L1_summary_of_paper": "This paper investigates how the technological overlap between a spinout venture and its parent firm influences a corporate venture capital (CVC) investor's decision to invest in that spinout. The key concept is 'competitive tension,' defined as the strain between a focal firm and a rival that is likely to result in action. Drawing primarily on the literature of competitive dynamics and employee entrepreneurship, the authors theorize that a high level of technological overlap between a spinout and its parent firm (TOSP) deters potential CVC investors. This deterrence stems from the CVC's anticipation of hostile actions (e.g., litigation) from the parent firm against the spinout, which creates significant investment risks. The study analyzes CVC investments in the U.S. medical device industry from 1995-2015. The main finding is a negative relationship between TOSP and the likelihood of receiving CVC investment. This negative effect is amplified when the parent firm has a strong history of litigation (higher risk) but is mitigated when the CVC can expect strategic benefits, such as when the CVC itself has high technological overlap with the parent firm or when the parent firm is highly innovative (higher benefit). The paper's primary contribution is to provide a more balanced view of employee entrepreneurship by demonstrating that technological inheritance from a parent firm can be a liability, and it extends competitive dynamics theory by showing that tension between two firms can be transmitted to affect a third party's behavior."

The study uniquely extends competitive dynamics theory to a triadic context, demonstrating how rivalry between two firms can spill over to influence the strategic decisions of an external actor."
