      "L1_summary_of_paper": "This paper presents a comprehensive narrative review of the evolution of theory and research in the strategic management field from its origins through the late 1990s. The central research question is to understand the developmental trajectory of the field. The authors propose the core metaphor of a 'pendulum swing' to characterize this evolution, arguing that the field's focus has cyclically swung between an internal perspective (focusing on the firm's unique resources, capabilities, and internal organization) and an external perspective (focusing on industry structure, competitive positioning, and the external environment). The paper identifies four major stages in this swing: 1) Early Development, rooted in business policy, which emphasized internal strengths and the strategy-structure fit using normative, case-based methods. 2) The Swing towards Industrial Organization (IO) Economics, driven by a quest for scientific rigor, which shifted the focus to the external environment using the Structure-Conduct-Performance (S-C-P) paradigm and large-sample quantitative methods. 3) A swing back towards the firm via Organizational Economics, which used Transaction Cost Economics (TCE) and Agency Theory to analyze firm boundaries, governance, and internal contracting, representing a middle ground. 4) A full return to the internal perspective with the rise of the Resource-Based View (RBV), which posits that a firm's unique, valuable, and inimitable resources are the primary source of sustained competitive advantage, a view that also prompted a renewed appreciation for qualitative and mixed-methods research. The main conclusion is that the field's development is not linear but a dynamic, enriching cycle where each swing builds upon and reacts to the limitations of the previous one. The paper's primary contribution is providing a powerful and enduring narrative framework for organizing the intellectual history of strategic management, helping to situate disparate theoretical streams and explaining the co-evolution of theory and methodology."
