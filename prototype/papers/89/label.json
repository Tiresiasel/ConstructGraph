      "L1_summary_of_paper": "This paper investigates when a market leader's imitation of a follower's actions can be an effective competitive strategy to avoid being overtaken ('dethronement'). The core research question is: Under what conditions can a 'follow the follower' strategy help a leader stay ahead? Theoretically framed within the competitive dynamics literature from an Austrian School perspective, the paper posits that followers' novel actions are 'disequilibrating' moves to disrupt the status quo, while the leader's imitation is a corresponding 'equilibrating' move to neutralize the threat and maintain competitive parity. The study examines two key constructs: 'action imitation' (imitating tactical moves) and 'positioning imitation' (imitating strategic positioning). It hypothesizes that both forms of imitation increase the leader's probability of staying ahead and that these strategies are complementary. The effectiveness of these strategies is argued to be contingent on three moderators: environmental uncertainty, the leader's initial advantage, and the follower-leader capability difference. The study uses a unique dataset of head-to-head sailing races from the 2011-12 America's Cup World Series, a setting which minimizes confounding social pressures and provides high-fidelity behavioral and performance data. The main findings, derived from probit regression models, support the core theses: both action and positioning imitation are effective defensive strategies and are complementary. The effectiveness of imitation is enhanced by a larger initial leader advantage and greater environmental uncertainty (for action imitation) but is weakened when the follower possesses a capability advantage. The paper's primary contribution is to redirect the competitive dynamics literature by providing a strong counterargument to the prevailing 'dissimilarity hypothesis,' demonstrating that imitation can be a sophisticated defensive strategy for leaders to destroy follower-created opportunities and maintain market equilibrium."
