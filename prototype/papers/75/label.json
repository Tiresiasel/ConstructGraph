    "L1_summary_of_paper": "This paper develops a formal model to analyze how competition among professional services firms influences their strategic design of Knowledge Management (KM) systems. The central research question is whether firms should design KM systems to primarily reduce costs (leveraging supply-side economies of scale, akin to 'learning by doing') or to enhance service quality (leveraging demand-side economies of scale, creating 'indirect network externalities'). The key concepts are KM system design, which is modeled as a strategic choice along a continuum between cost reduction and quality enhancement, and the 'ability to leverage the customer base,' which represents the marginal benefit gained from each client. The theoretical framework integrates the literature on learning curves and network externalities by making the type of scale economy an endogenous firm choice. The unit of analysis is the firm within a duopolistic market structure. The paper's main findings, derived from a game-theoretic model, are threefold. First, unlike a monopolist who always prefers cost reduction, competing firms will strategically shift their KM focus to quality enhancement when their ability to leverage the customer base is high. This is because a quality focus generates favorable customer expectations, which becomes a powerful competitive weapon. Second, in a dynamic setting, the anticipation of future benefits from a large customer base (or 'installed knowledge') leads to aggressive current-period competition, potentially eroding overall profits. Third, high leverage ability can amplify initial quality differences between firms, potentially leading to industry shakeouts and concentration. The paper's primary contribution is to provide a formal economic rationale for how KM design serves as a competitive tool and to offer a theoretical explanation for contemporary trends in the consulting industry, such as the increased emphasis on knowledge creation, the wave of mergers, and the emergence of low-cost 'retail consulting' services.",
