    "L1_summary_of_paper": "The paper tests whether managerial ties in China always create value and shows their value is contingent on ownership (domestic vs. foreign) and market forces (competitive intensity, structural uncertainty). Managerial ties are top managers’ boundary-spanning connections with other firms (business ties) and with government officials (political ties). Drawing on social capital/embeddedness and liability-of-foreignness, the authors argue: (i) foreign and domestic firms use ties at similar levels; (ii) ties have a monotonic positive effect for domestic firms but an inverted-U effect for foreign firms due to political, cultural, and organizational frictions; (iii) competition weakens the tie–performance link; (iv) structural uncertainty strengthens it. Using a 2003 survey of 280 manufacturing firms in Beijing/Guangzhou/Shanghai (measuring 2000–2002 ties) merged with industry data (competition and uncertainty, 2000–2002) and archival ROA in 2005, hierarchical moderated regressions support all hypotheses. Contributions: specifies boundary conditions for social capital in emerging markets, documents a liability-of-foreignness in extracting value from ties, and adjudicates between market-efficiency vs. social-capital logics by showing opposing moderation effects of competition (negative) and uncertainty (positive).",
