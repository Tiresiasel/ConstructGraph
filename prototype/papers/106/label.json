      "L1_summary_of_paper": "This paper investigates whether the positive relationship between strategic consensus and performance, established in studies of single firms, generalizes to cooperative arrangements between entrepreneurs, specifically within franchise systems. The core research question is how consensus on both 'means of competition' (resource allocation priorities) and 'desired ends' (goals and values) between franchisees and franchisors relates to outcomes. The study integrates strategic management's consensus literature with the entrepreneurship literature on cooperative arrangements. Key constructs are Perceived Consensus on Means (operationalized into three factors: product/brand development, efficiency, customer service), Perceived Consensus on Ends (goals and values), and the outcomes of Competitive Advantage, Business Performance, and Franchisee Satisfaction. The research context is the U.S. fast-food industry, based on a 1991 survey of 162 franchisees. The main findings are twofold: 1) Significant dissension on the means of competition is prevalent, with franchisees perceiving themselves as having higher standards than their franchisors. 2) Consensus on desired ends is a strong, consistent, and positive predictor of all three outcomes. In contrast, consensus on means has a more limited and specific effect. The paper's primary contribution is redirecting consensus theory for inter-organizational contexts, demonstrating that in cooperative dyads, consensus on 'why' (ends) is more critical than consensus on 'how' (means), thereby enriching both strategy and entrepreneurship theory."

This finding challenges the direct generalizability of internal management theories and highlights the foundational importance of goal congruence in managing cooperative relationships between entrepreneurs."
