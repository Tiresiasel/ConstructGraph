      "L1_summary_of_paper": "This study investigates the antecedents and performance consequences of competitive repertoire complexity, defined as a dynamic and diverse array of competitive actions. The central research questions are: 1) How does competitive repertoire complexity affect firm performance over different time horizons? and 2) What corporate governance mechanisms drive firms to adopt complex competitive repertoires? Theoretically, the paper challenges the conventional wisdom that complexity is always beneficial, proposing a more nuanced temporal perspective. It integrates agency theory and tournament theory to explain the governance antecedents. The core constructs are competitive repertoire complexity (a composite measure of action diversity, change, and newness), firm performance (short-term ROA and long-term ROA trend), dedicated and transient institutional ownership, and the CEO-TMT pay gap. The study uses a large panel dataset of 1,168 U.S. public firms across 204 industries from 2001-2010. The main findings are that complexity initially harms short-term performance but has an inverted U-shaped relationship with the long-term performance trend. Furthermore, dedicated institutional ownership and a wider CEO-TMT pay gap are both positively associated with competitive complexity. A key finding is the complementary interaction between these two governance mechanisms, where firms build especially complex repertoires when both influences are strong. The paper's primary contributions are twofold: it provides a more textured, temporal understanding of the complexity-performance link, revealing both its costs and benefits; and it bridges the literature on corporate governance and competitive dynamics by identifying ownership structure and executive compensation as key drivers of a firm's competitive posture."
