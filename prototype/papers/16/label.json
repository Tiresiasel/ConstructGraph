    "L1_summary_of_paper": "Formal analytical model of a vertically differentiated duopoly showing how two social-interaction mechanisms reshape firms’ quality choices, pricing, profits, and welfare across two selling periods. Market-expansion effect (MEE) is a cross-brand, informative spillover: first-period sales enlarge the second-period potential market for everyone. Value-enhancement effect (VEE) is product-exclusive utility gain (network-like): a buyer’s utility rises with the same-brand’s current and/or prior sales (VEE-C, VEE-P). Stage 1: firms simultaneously choose qualities (upper bound normalized to 1). Stage 2: they set committed prices for two periods (dynamic pricing and cost structures analyzed as extensions). Core results: For given qualities, both MEE and VEE intensify price competition; however, in equilibrium MEE induces the low-quality firm to raise quality (shrinking differentiation), lowers both firms’ prices, increases both demands and profits, and raises consumer surplus and social welfare (win–win). VEE pushes the low-quality firm to lower quality (widening differentiation), raises the high-quality firm’s price and profit while reducing the low-quality firm’s profit (Matthew effect); consumer monetary surplus falls, although total welfare can rise once the added social utility is counted; patterns are qualitatively robust for both VEE-C and VEE-P and under dynamic pricing (effects largely unchanged). Combined-effects numerics show that relative magnitudes of MEE and VEE govern outcomes, with VEE-C generally stronger than VEE-P.",
