    "L1_summary_of_paper": "This study develops and tests the theory of Vicarious Performance Feedback (VPF) to explain tie dissolution in market networks. Under conditions of causal ambiguity, when it is difficult to evaluate a supplier's contribution based solely on direct experience, managers may observe the performance trajectories of other firms that share the same supplier (relative to their own historical baselines) to supplement their evaluation. Using a 33-year panel (1981–2013) of Formula 1 constructors and engine suppliers (432 constructor–year observations, 57 constructors), combined with 55 interviews, the authors find: (1) firms are more likely to switch suppliers when their own performance falls below aspiration (baseline performance feedback effect); (2) negative deviations of other customers' performance from their historical levels increase the likelihood of supplier tie dissolution (VPF main effect); (3) the VPF effect is stronger when the focal firm’s own performance is below aspirations, when there are more joint users (reducing noise in the vicarious signal), and when geographic distance to the supplier is greater (reducing alternative information channels). The paper extends performance feedback from direct to vicarious information, embeds network structure (structural equivalence/joint users) into partner evaluation, and enriches the cognitive foundations of problemistic search and attention allocation under causal ambiguity.",
