      "L1_summary_of_paper": "This study investigates the phenomenon of hypercompetition within the prepackaged software industry from 1990 to 2002. The central research question is what drives hypercompetition and how firms can create and renew temporary advantages in such an environment. The key concepts are 'complementarity' (relationships among product markets) and 'dynamic capabilities' (a firm's ability to manage these relationships). The paper's theoretical framework integrates the economic Theory of Complementarities, the NK model of performance landscapes, and the Dynamic Capabilities View. It proposes that dynamically changing complementarity relationships at the industry level create a rugged and shifting performance landscape, leading to hypercompetition (i.e., frequent changes in firms' performance ranks). The study examines the relationship between a firm's (ISV) performance rank and its firm-level complementarity strategies, specifically: (1) the complementarity within its existing product portfolio, (2) the portfolio's complementarity position within the broader industry network, (3) the firm's ability to reconfigure resources in response to changes, and (4) its ability to reposition its portfolio through market entry and exit. Using a large longitudinal dataset of 1,200 ISVs, the main findings show that the software industry did exhibit increasing hypercompetition over the period. Firm performance rank was positively associated with having a product portfolio with a strong complementarity position in the industry, and with dynamic capabilities for reconfiguring resources and making coherent market entry/exit moves that strengthen the portfolio's complementarity. The study's main contribution is providing a novel, empirically-tested, micro-foundational theory for hypercompetition, shifting the focus from simply observing the phenomenon to explaining its underlying drivers based on the dynamics of inter-product complementarity."
