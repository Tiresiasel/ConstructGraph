    "L1_summary_of_paper": "This paper investigates how competitive market conditions shape firms’ escalation of commitment to underperforming initiatives, conceptualizing competitors as external reference points that enable or constrain continued investment. Escalation of commitment is defined as a firm’s tendency to persist in allocating resources to a failing course of action. Integrating escalation behavior literature with competitive dynamics theory, the authors theorize that the actions and performance of rivals—differentiated by relative size—inform decision makers’ justifications for persistence. Specifically, they propose that larger competitors’ high action volume signals opportunity and urgency, encouraging escalation; smaller competitors’ positive performance signals a low capability threshold for success, also encouraging escalation; and larger competitors’ negative performance signals unfavorable conditions, discouraging escalation. Using panel event history data (1998–2011) on 51 leading Taiwanese IT companies’ investments in various Chinese provinces and municipalities, supplemented by three waves of field interviews, they estimate Cox proportional hazard models of repeated strategic actions in loss-incurring locations. Results support all three hypotheses, with robust findings across alternative specifications and subsamples. The study contributes by identifying structural determinants of escalation, highlighting the informational asymmetry of rival cues based on relative size, and bridging behavioral bias research with competitive dynamics under adverse performance conditions.",
