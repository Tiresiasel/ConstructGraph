    "L1_summary_of_paper": "This study by Miller and Chen (1996) investigates the concept of 'competitive simplicity'—the tendency of firms to focus their competitive repertoires on a narrow set of action types—within the U.S. post-deregulation airline industry (1979–1986). Competitive repertoires are defined as the set of market-oriented actions taken annually to attract, serve, and retain customers (e.g., pricing changes, product/service alterations, market expansions). Simplicity is operationalized through three indices: range (number of action types), concentration (focus on a few types), and dominance (reliance on the most frequent action type). The authors theorize that competitive simplicity is shaped by organizational and environmental factors that reduce managerial search incentives or limit knowledge of alternatives—such as past good performance, market munificence, homogeneity, firm age, size, and narrow competitive experience—and that simplicity may harm performance in uncertain, diverse, or growing markets. Using a pooled time-series cross-section of 18 major national carriers, with competitive actions coded from Aviation Daily into 21 action types (891 total actions), the study tests hypotheses via autoregressive-heteroscedastic OLS models. Results show that past performance, larger firm size, low market diversity, and high market growth increase simplicity; breadth of competitive experience and market diversity decrease simplicity; age and market uncertainty show no main effects. Simplicity (especially low range and high concentration) is associated with reduced subsequent performance, with negative effects amplified in high-growth markets and, for range, in high-uncertainty periods. The paper contributes by integrating organizational learning and contingency perspectives into competitive dynamics research, developing robust measures of repertoire simplicity, and linking repertoire structure to performance contingently on environmental conditions.",
