      "L1_summary_of_paper": "This conceptual paper develops a theory of 'factor-market rivalry' to complement the existing, predominantly 'product-market' focused, view of competitive dynamics. The core research question is why, how, and when firms compete over resources in factor markets (e.g., inputs, technologies, human capital), especially when they do not overlap in product markets. The authors define factor-market rivalry as competition over resource positions, arguing it can erupt anywhere along a firm's value chain. The theory introduces several key concepts: 'resource versatility' (a resource's applicability across diverse missions) and 'resource mobility' (a resource's transferability) are identified as key drivers that make even non-VRIN resources contestable. The paper outlines two primary mechanisms of factor-market attacks under the umbrella of 'resource discontinuity': 1) 'resource leapfrogging,' where an entrant uses novel resources to make an incumbent's resource-capability mix obsolete, and 2) 'resource captivity,' where a firm holds up or seizes resources critical to a rival, potentially triggering 'cascading effects' throughout the rival's value chain. The theory is framed as an extension of competitive dynamics research (e.g., Chen, 1996) and an integration of the resource-based view (RBV). It applies this new lens to refine mutual forbearance theory, proposing a 2x2 matrix of product-market and factor-market overlap to predict rivalry intensity, awareness, and the motivation to forbear. The main conclusion is that the most dangerous rivals are often 'atypical' competitors from unrelated industries, creating 'competitive blind spots' for firms with a narrow product-market focus. The paper's primary contribution is redirecting scholarly attention to the upstream, factor-market sources of competition, thereby providing a more holistic and predictive model of rivalry that can account for disruptive, cross-industry competition."

It provides a novel and systematic framework for explaining and predicting rivalry between atypical competitors from different industries, identifying the mechanisms (resource leapfrogging, resource captivity) through which such competition occurs, and highlighting the critical role of resource attributes (versatility, mobility) in triggering these contests. This new lens helps explain the origins of competitive blind spots and disruptive threats, offering a more complete and nuanced understanding of the competitive landscape."
