      "L1_summary_of_paper": "This paper investigates how an entrepreneur's social capital, derived from different types of relationship networks, affects the economic performance of their small business. It also examines the moderating roles of industry competitive intensity and the entrepreneur's experience. The study integrates the resource-based view (RBV) with social capital theory, conceptualizing social capital not just as network structure, but as the tangible resources (financial, technological, commercial, etc.) embedded within four distinct networks: personal, associative, professional, and institutional. Based on a survey of 951 small firms in Spain, the study finds that resources from professional and institutional networks have a significant positive relationship with economic performance (measured by sales growth, market position, and innovation success), while resources from personal and associative networks do not show a significant direct effect. However, these relationships are conditional. High competitive intensity weakens the positive effect of institutional network resources but strengthens the effect of personal network resources, highlighting the value of inimitable, private networks in rivalrous environments. Furthermore, as an entrepreneur's industry experience increases, the positive impact of resources from professional and institutional networks is amplified. The paper contributes to the literature by (1) simultaneously analyzing and comparing the performance effects of four distinct types of entrepreneurial networks, (2) identifying and testing key boundary conditions (competitive intensity and experience) that alter the value of these networks, and (3) operationalizing social capital directly as the resources accessed, rather than as a structural proxy."

It establishes that a strategic, dynamic approach to managing a portfolio of social ties is critical for small business success."
