      "L1_summary_of_paper": "This paper develops a process model to explain how a shared strategic group identity shapes both competitive and cooperative behaviors among firms. Addressing empirical puzzles where firms cooperate under resource scarcity and compete for status rather than price, the study uses an inductive, qualitative analysis of 41 gourmet food trucks (GFTs). The core theoretical contribution is the distinction between two types of group prototypes that constitute the strategic group identity: 'central tendencies' (attributes of a typical member) and 'ideal tendencies' (attributes of a highly regarded member). The main finding is that these two prototypes drive different behaviors. Members cooperate (e.g., sharing resources and knowledge) to help each other meet the group's central tendencies, which reinforces the group's overall distinction from outsiders (like traditional food trucks). Conversely, members compete to best embody the group's ideal tendencies, which fosters a status-based hierarchy and enhances the group's overall prestige. The model also includes 'identity preservation practices' (adjusting and sanctioning) that members use to maintain the integrity of the identity when it is threatened. The paper contributes to strategic group and competitive dynamics literature by providing a micro-foundational, identity-based explanation for the coexistence of cooperation and competition, challenging the traditional view that resource similarity primarily drives rivalry."

By introducing and distinguishing between central and ideal prototypes within a group identity, it provides a novel and robust explanation for why and how competing firms engage in extensive cooperation, welcome new entrants, and channel rivalry into non-price, status-based contests. This reframes strategic groups not just as arenas for competition, but as communities that actively co-create and govern market behavior through a shared identity."
