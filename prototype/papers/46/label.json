      "L1_summary_of_paper": "This editorial commentary by Connelly and Shi (2022) addresses the need for a more structured approach to studying organizational threats and responses. The authors argue that while concepts like strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities are well-defined, the literature on threats lacks a cohesive framework. They propose a framework to help scholars position their research, delineating threats into external (environmental, governance, competitive) and internal (micro-level, macro-level) types. The paper introduces a set of constructs for analyzing how managers assess threats (certainty, vulnerability, severity) and the common response options (fight, flee, freeze). It also covers response appraisal (likelihood, speed, efficacy), the behavioral effects of threats (cognitive constraints, control concentration, resource allocation), and threat externalities (contagion, escalation). The authors highlight several key theories, including established ones like Threat Rigidity Theory and the Awareness-Motivation-Capability (AMC) Framework, and introduce two less-utilized in management: Protection Motivation Theory and Integrated Threat Theory. The primary contribution is the development of a comprehensive, multi-level framework (summarized in Table 1) that organizes existing concepts and identifies new theoretical avenues. The paper concludes with a call for research to apply and extend these theories to understand the evolving landscape of threats faced by modern organizations and their managers."
