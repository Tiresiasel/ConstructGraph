      "L1_summary_of_paper": "This study investigates how a multinational corporation (MNC) can promote the absorptive capacity of its subsidiaries. The core research question is: What are the driving forces of a subsidiary's ability to absorb marketing strategies initiated by the MNC parent, and how do these forces relate to the subsidiary's local market conditions? The key concepts are 'subsidiary absorptive capacity', defined as the ability to recognize the value of, assimilate, and apply new knowledge, and its 'enactment', which is the successful integration of that knowledge. The theoretical framing integrates Cohen and Levinthal's absorptive capacity theory with international business literature on MNC knowledge flows and the environmental-strategy-performance paradigm. The study examines the relationships between subsidiary market conditions (competitiveness and dynamism), specific MNC organizational mechanisms (decentralization, normative integration, innovative culture), subsidiary absorptive capacity (as a second-order latent construct), and the enactment of this capacity. The context is a cross-sectional survey of 213 Australian subsidiaries of foreign-owned MNCs. The main findings show that decentralization, normative integration, and an innovative culture are significant positive drivers of subsidiary absorptive capacity. Furthermore, competitive and dynamic market conditions positively influence the MNC's adoption of these organizational mechanisms. A key finding is that subsidiary absorptive capacity fully mediates the relationship between the organizational mechanisms and the successful enactment of the marketing strategy. The paper's primary contribution is to empirically identify specific, manageable organizational antecedents of absorptive capacity within an intra-firm, international context, validating it as a latent construct and demonstrating its critical mediating role in translating organizational design into strategic outcomes."
