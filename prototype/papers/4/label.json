  "L1_summary_of_paper": "The paper develops a formal model to explain when and why industry leaders in hypercompetitive environments rationally choose to renew advantages more slowly (longer development time) despite faster erosion of rents, thereby increasing the probability of displacement—\"self-displacement.\" Two industry-level forces drive hypercompetition: imitation (exponential decay of abnormal returns at rate δ) and innovation (Poisson arrival at rate λ that instantaneously displaces the leader). The leader chooses the development time T of the next advantage to maximize the present value of expected revenues net of convex time-compression costs derived from resource-accumulation microfoundations; revenues before and after launch decay with δ and are truncated by λ. Across four environment types—stable, imitative, innovative, and dual hypercompetition—the model yields comparative statics: (i) in stable settings, accelerate when the new advantage has higher market value, lower complexity, lower discount rate, and higher speed capability; (ii) with imitative hypercompetition, accelerate if the new advantage has low relative market value (versus the existing one) but decelerate if its relative market value is high; imitation lags push toward further deceleration; (iii) with innovative hypercompetition, leaders often optimally renew more slowly, accepting higher displacement risk (self-displacement), because acceleration buys little expected revenue but raises costs; and (iv) under dual hypercompetition, a rule of thumb is to accelerate only advantages with high competitive value but low market value and otherwise avoid costly time compression. The contribution integrates industry macrodynamics (δ, λ) with firm microdynamics (time-compression diseconomies) to overturn the simple \"go faster\" prescription and introduces self-displacement as a rational, profit-maximizing mechanism for leader turnover.",
