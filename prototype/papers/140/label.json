      "L1_summary_of_paper": "This paper investigates how rivals' perceptions of a CEO's personal characteristics precipitate competitive attacks against that CEO's firm. It introduces and integrates 'victimization theory' from criminology and social psychology into the strategic management literature on 'upper echelons theory' and 'competitive dynamics'. The core argument is that CEO characteristics have a 'second-order effect': beyond influencing their own firm's actions (a first-order effect), they also influence rivals' actions toward their firm. The study focuses on two key perceived CEO traits: 'submissiveness' (perceived unwillingness or inability to respond to attacks) and 'provocativeness' (perceived as threatening or violating norms). Using a sample of Fortune 500 CEOs from 2000-2016, the study employs a novel 'videometric' methodology to assess these traits based on third-party ratings of public videos. Competitive attacks (pricing, product, marketing, expansion) are measured using RavenPack news data. The main findings show that both perceived CEO submissiveness and provocativeness are significantly and positively associated with a higher number of competitive attacks directed at the CEO's firm. The effect of submissiveness is found to be particularly strong. The study's main contribution is offering a more socialized and complete theory of competitive attacks, demonstrating that the personal characteristics of a target firm's leader can make the firm a 'victim' by either appearing as an 'easy target' (submissive) or a 'provocative threat'. This reframes the CEO's role from solely a perpetrator of action to also a factor that precipitates incoming attacks."

This provides a more complete understanding of why firms become targets of aggression and broadens the scope of upper echelons theory."
