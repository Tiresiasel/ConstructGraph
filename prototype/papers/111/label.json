      "L1_summary_of_paper": "This conceptual paper challenges the dominant 'atomistic' view in strategy research—which treats firms as autonomous entities—by proposing a 'relational' or network-based perspective. The central research question is how incorporating an understanding of strategic networks can deepen the explanation for why firms differ in conduct and performance. Key concepts defined include 'strategic networks' (enduring, strategically significant inter-firm ties like alliances) and their analytical dimensions: network structure (e.g., density, structural holes), network membership (partner characteristics), and tie modality (governing norms). The paper's theoretical framing argues that a firm's embeddedness in these networks is a primary source of opportunities (access to information, resources, markets) and constraints (lock-in, exclusion). It systematically applies this network lens to five core areas of strategy: (1) industry structure, (2) positioning within an industry, (3) inimitable firm resources, (4) contracting costs, and (5) dynamic evolution. The main conclusion is that traditional strategy models are incomplete without considering the network context. For instance, network density can facilitate collusion beyond what industry concentration predicts; 'network resources' are a new class of inimitable assets for the resource-based view; and trust within networks can lower transaction costs. The paper’s primary contribution is providing a foundational research agenda and theoretical framework for integrating network theory into the mainstream of strategic management, shifting the focus from purely internal or market-based sources of advantage to relational ones."
