      "L1_summary_of_paper": "This study investigates the nature of the relationship between the timing of a competitive response and the performance of both the responding firm (responder) and the initial mover (first mover). The central research question is: What is the nature of the response timing-performance relationship? The paper challenges the traditionally assumed negative linear relationship between response delay and responder performance. It integrates perspectives from economics, marketing, and management on first-mover advantages with concepts of 'conscious choices' and cognitive 'blind spots' from behavioral strategy. The core constructs are 'response delay' (the time between an action and a response) and 'firm performance' (measured as stock market effects). The study proposes and tests two central hypotheses in the context of the U.S. retail industry from 1994-2000: (1) The relationship between response delay and responder performance is curvilinear (an inverted U-shape), where very fast and very slow responses are suboptimal, while intermediate delays yield the highest performance. (2) The relationship between response delay and first-mover performance is positive and linear, as longer delays provide the first mover more time to build advantages. Using event study methodology on a dataset of 370 competitive moves, the findings support both hypotheses. The key conclusion is that the performance effects of response timing are not symmetrical for the attacker and the responder. The paper's main contribution is to redirect the literature away from a simple 'faster is better' prescription for competitive responses, highlighting the risks of responding too quickly and proposing a more nuanced, non-linear model for responders."
