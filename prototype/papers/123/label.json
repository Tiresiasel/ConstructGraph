      "L1_summary_of_paper": "This paper investigates how groups of organizations, specifically non-diversified groups without shared ownership, affect the performance of their members and the competitive dynamics of their industry. The core research question is how experience is transferred within and between these groups and what the performance implications are. The key concepts are 'organization groups' (defined as cooperative relations with variable boundaries, studied here as Israeli kibbutz federations), 'experience transfer', and the 'Red Queen effect' of competition. The theoretical framing integrates organizational learning (experience curve) with competitive dynamics. The study examines the relationship between a focal organization's profitability and three types of experience: its own, that of others within its group (federation), and that of others outside its group. The context is the Israeli kibbutz agricultural sector from 1954 to 1965. Using longitudinal fixed-effects regression, the main finding is twofold: 1) Experience accumulated by other organizations within the same federation positively affects a focal kibbutz's profitability, indicating effective knowledge transfer. 2) Experience accumulated by organizations outside the federation negatively affects profitability, demonstrating a strong competitive (Red Queen) effect. The paper's primary contribution is to simultaneously model and evidence the dual role of organization groups as conduits for internal learning and as bases for external competition, shifting the focus from ownership-based ties to voluntary affiliations and from internal efficiency metrics to the more comprehensive measure of profitability."
