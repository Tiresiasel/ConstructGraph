      "L1_summary_of_paper": "This conceptual paper addresses the research question of why and when firms use verbal statements ('word responses') to respond to a rival's competitive attack, as opposed to taking direct action. The key concept introduced is the 'word response,' defined as a public statement prompted by a competitor's attack, which is distinct from 'action responses' and costless 'cheap talk' due to reputational costs and commitment value. The paper's theoretical framing extends the classic Awareness-Motivation-Capability (AMC) model from competitive dynamics (CD) research. It theorizes that firms resort to word responses when one or more of the AMC drivers for an effective action response are impeded. The core of the paper is a 2x2 framework that uses two characteristics of a competitive attack—its magnitude (minor vs. major) and complexity (simple vs. complex)—to predict the likelihood of a word versus an action response. The main findings are presented as four propositions: 1) minor, simple attacks are most likely to elicit an action response; 2) minor, complex attacks are likely to elicit an initial word response to seek information; 3) major, simple attacks are likely to elicit a word response to deter rivalry without escalating commitment; and 4) major, complex attacks are likely to elicit an initial word response due to challenges in all three AMC drivers. The paper's primary contribution is redirecting CD literature from its implicit action-only bias by formally integrating language as a strategic tool, thereby providing a more complete understanding of competitive engagement."
