      "L1_summary_of_paper": "This paper investigates the independent and interactive causal effects of competition and resource scarcity on interpersonal communication within organizations. The central research question is whether the decline in communication observed in organizations during adverse events is driven by the scarcity of resources itself, or by the competitive incentive structures within the firm. The study defines competition as 'structural competition' (negative goal interdependence via relative performance incentives) and scarcity as 'objective, episodic scarcity' (an exogenous, downward shift in environmental resources). The theoretical framing draws primarily on social interdependence theory to predict the effects of competition, and the social learning strategies (SLS) literature to explore potential effects of environmental shocks. Using a novel online laboratory experiment called 'The Sales Game', the study manipulates the presence of a trivial competitive bonus (Trivial Competition vs. No Competition) and the trajectory of resource availability (Scarcity vs. Abundance vs. a stable Control). The core constructs studied are the rates of 'information sharing' and 'information seeking' among peers in small groups. The main finding is that even a trivially small competitive incentive significantly and substantially reduces both information sharing and seeking. In stark contrast, negative resource shocks (scarcity) have no discernible effect on these communication behaviors, nor is there an interaction between competition and scarcity. The paper's primary contribution is to causally disentangle this long-standing confound in organizational research, demonstrating that the 'social pollution' of competitive incentives—not environmental hardship—is the key driver of communication breakdown. This has significant practical implications for the design of incentive systems, warning that even minor uses of relative performance metrics can have severe, negative consequences for knowledge exchange and cooperation."
