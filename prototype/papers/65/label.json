      "L1_summary_of_paper": "This paper investigates how a firm's reputation is dynamically shaped by its own market actions and the competitive context, including industry structure and rivals' actions. Drawing primarily on signaling theory, the study posits that observable market actions, such as pricing changes or new product introductions, serve as signals that convey information about a firm's unobservable competencies and strategic intent to stakeholders. These stakeholders then use these signals to form impressions, which constitute the firm's reputation. The core constructs studied are firm reputation (measured by Fortune's 'Most Admired Corporations' survey) and characteristics of market actions (total number, repertoire complexity, timing, and similarity to rivals), which are captured through a structured content analysis of news articles. The context is a panel of 37 large U.S. firms across 10 industries over a 7-year period. Using fixed-effects regression, the main findings are that a firm's reputation is positively influenced by the total number of its market actions, the complexity (diversity) of its action repertoire, the time lag in rivals' responses to its actions, and the similarity of its action repertoire to those of its rivals. Furthermore, the positive effect of action repertoire complexity is stronger in more concentrated industries. The study did not find support for the idea that the sheer volume or complexity of rival actions negatively impacts a firm's reputation. The paper's primary contribution is to provide one of the first large-scale empirical tests of the idea that dynamic market behaviors, not just static firm attributes, are a key mechanism for building reputation. It integrates the competitive dynamics perspective with reputation research, offering a more nuanced, context-sensitive model of reputation formation that accounts for the signaling effects of both a firm's own actions and the actions of its competitors."

First, it provides crucial, large-scale empirical validation for the long-held theoretical idea that a firm's reputation is built through its dynamic market actions. Second, it enriches reputation theory by integrating concepts from competitive dynamics, such as action repertoire complexity, demonstrating that the diversity of competitive moves is a key signal of capability. Third, it advances a more sophisticated view of competitive context by showing that rivals' actions can have positive 'complementor' effects (signaling legitimacy and inimitability) on a firm's reputation, challenging a simplistic zero-sum view of reputational competition."
