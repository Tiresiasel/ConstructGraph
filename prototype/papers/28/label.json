    "L1_summary_of_paper": "This integrative review consolidates the strategic cognition (SC) literature from 1993–2007 and proposes a multi-level framework linking antecedents (environmental, organizational, decision-specific, individual) to cognitive structures (organizational identity, strategy frames, organizational routines), cognitive processes (strategy formulation, implementation, strategic change, organizational learning), and outcomes (process outcomes, strategic actions, economic outcomes). The paper synthesizes five empirical streams—(1) antecedents and outcomes of strategy frames, (2) determinants and consequences of strategy formulation, (3) cognitive construction of competitive/industry dynamics, (4) determinants and consequences of strategy implementation, and (5) antecedents and outcomes of organizational identity—classifying (1–3) as well-developed and (4–5) as emerging. It clarifies key concepts (e.g., sensemaking/sensegiving, issue selling), debates (e.g., stability vs. fluidity of identity; homogeneity vs. heterogeneity of frames), and operationalizations (causal maps, text analysis, surveys, ethnography), and outlines a research agenda emphasizing multi-level linkages, better measurement, and tighter integration with core strategy theories. Main conclusion: cognition is causal to strategy via how actors notice, interpret, and routinize, shaping actions and performance through attention filters and interpretive processes.",
