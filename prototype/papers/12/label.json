  "L1_summary_of_paper": "This paper analyzes how two orthogonal dimensions of intra-industry heterogeneity—strategic similarity (similarity in competitive orientation independent of specific markets) and multimarket contact (degree of overlap across multiple markets)—shape the intensity of rivalry in a hypercompetitive multimarket environment. Using the U.S. airline industry (1984–1988), the authors model firm–market (airline–route) yield (price per passenger-mile) as an inverse proxy for competitive intensity and estimate fixed-effects panel regressions with extensive controls. Theory provides competing predictions for strategic similarity: a coordination-enhancing view (strategic groups) versus a substitutability view (IO product differentiation/RBV). Multimarket competition theory predicts that higher multimarket contact (MMC) reduces rivalry via credible cross-market retaliation (mutual forbearance). Empirically, when considered alone, both similarity and MMC are positively associated with yield; however, when entered together, MMC remains strongly positive (rivalry-reducing), while the coefficient on strategic similarity becomes significantly negative, indicating that, net of MMC, greater similarity intensifies rivalry through increased substitutability. The sign reversal is not due to multicollinearity; rather, omitting MMC biases the similarity effect. Contributions include cleanly separating two distinct heterogeneity dimensions with opposite implications for rivalry, adjudicating conflicting claims in strategic group research, and extending hypercompetition arguments by showing how stronghold invasion can evolve into restraint as MMC rises.",
