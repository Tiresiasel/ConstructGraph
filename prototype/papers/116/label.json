      "L1_summary_of_paper": "This paper investigates why a platform owner's entry into its complementors' market spaces yields contradictory outcomes—sometimes negative, sometimes positive—for those complementors. The core research question is: What drives these different performance outcomes? The authors integrate platform governance theory with competitive dynamics theory to argue that the effect of entry is not uniform but is contingent on the owner's 'mode of entry,' which is a manifestation of its broader, stable platform governance approach. The study distinguishes between a 'closed and reigning' governance model (e.g., Apple) and an 'open and laissez-faire' model (e.g., Google). The central thesis is that a closed approach leads to an aggressive entry, creating high competitive pressure that harms complementors, while an open approach leads to a more cooperative entry, creating positive spillovers that benefit complementors. Using the near-simultaneous launch of Apple Health and Google Fit in the health and fitness app ecosystem as a quasi-natural experiment, the study analyzes a panel dataset of apps. The main findings show that Apple's entry was associated with a significant decrease in affected complementors' performance (downloads) and subsequent investment (new app releases). Conversely, Google's entry was associated with a significant increase in complementor performance and investment. The paper's key contribution is to resolve the existing empirical puzzle by identifying platform governance and the resulting entry mode as a critical contingency, thereby advancing our understanding of intra-platform competition and strategy."
