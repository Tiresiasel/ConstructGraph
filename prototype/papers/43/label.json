      "L1_summary_of_paper": "This study investigates corporate venture capital (CVC) investment as a form of inter-firm rivalry, asking how and why a firm's CVC investment provokes matching responses from its competitors. The key concepts are CVC investment (a minority-stake equity investment by an established firm in an entrepreneurial venture), competitive dynamics (a framework of action and response), and matching response (a rival making a similar CVC investment in the same industry). The paper's theoretical framing integrates competitive dynamics theory with signaling theory, proposing that a CVC investment's characteristics act as competitive signals. The core constructs studied are the investment's funding amount, its industry relatedness to the corporate investor, and the investor's reputation, and their relationship with the likelihood of a rival's matching response. The context is U.S. public firms across 81 industries from 2000 to 2014. The main findings show that higher funding amounts and greater industry relatedness increase the likelihood of a rival's matching response, whereas a higher investor reputation decreases it. The paper's primary contribution is to bridge the CVC and competitive dynamics literatures, conceptualizing CVC as a competitive action within an action-response framework rather than just an internal strategic tool for learning or resource acquisition."
