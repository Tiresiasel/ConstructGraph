    "L1_summary_of_paper": "Danneels (2012) theorizes and tests how firms’ second-order competences—capabilities to create new resources—translate into profitability via a Schumpeterian competition process, contingent on competitive turbulence. He distinguishes second-order marketing competence (ability to add new market-related resources and customer competences) and second-order R&D competence (ability to add new technological resources and technological competences), arguing these dynamic capabilities generate Schumpeterian rents (rents from resource flow/renewal) rather than Ricardian rents (from existing resource stocks). Using multiple-informant surveys in 2007 for U.S. public manufacturing firms and archival ROA (2007–2009) from Compustat, he tests that competitive turbulence negatively moderates the marketing-competence → ROA link and positively moderates the R&D-competence → ROA link. Results support both: marketing competence predicts ROA under low/moderate turbulence but not under high turbulence; R&D competence predicts ROA only when turbulence is high. This links dynamic capabilities to performance through a competitive-process lens and clarifies environmental contingencies in capability value, while providing operational measures of second-order competences.
