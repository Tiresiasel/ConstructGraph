  "L1_summary_of_paper": "This study examines whether within-industry (intra-industry) diversification improves firm performance and through what mechanisms. It integrates three lenses: (1) synergy creation/economies of scope from operating across related niches; (2) multi-market contact (MMC) that can enable mutual forbearance under the shadow of cross-market retaliation; and (3) an industry-level mechanism termed market structuration—the field-wide social construction of relatedness among niches that lowers coordination costs and legitimates concurrent operation. Using a panel of Canadian property & casualty insurers (≈276 firms, 1993–1998), the authors model next-year ROA on measures of diversification (entropy), MMC, similarity-weighted MMC, and relatedness-weighted diversification based on an industry relatedness matrix derived from firms’ co-presence patterns across 205 geography×product niches. Main findings: diversification (entropy) alone is not associated with higher performance; average MMC is negatively associated with performance; when rivals are more similar in portfolio/scale, MMC becomes positively associated with performance (consistent with mutual forbearance); and relatedness-weighted diversification is positively associated with performance. Contribution: redirects the diversification–performance debate from ‘scope alone’ to conditional mutual forbearance and industry-level structuration as the primary channels linking within-industry diversification to performance.",
