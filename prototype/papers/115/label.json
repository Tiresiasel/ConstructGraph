      "L1_summary_of_paper": "This paper investigates how a firm's positioning within its network of perceived competitors affects its product innovation. The central research question is: How is a firm's position in perceived competition networks associated with its product innovation? The study defines a 'perceived competition network' as a relational structure emerging from a firm's subjective, and often asymmetric, identification of rivals, distinct from objective networks based on market overlap. The theoretical framing integrates organizational learning and network embeddedness theories, proposing that a firm's unique competitive viewpoint stimulates differentiated search and learning, leading to innovation. The core constructs studied are three forms of network embeddedness: structural (spanning structural holes), positional (perceiving peripheral competitors), and relational (competitor churn), and their relationship with the rate of new product introductions. The study is set in the U.S. enterprise infrastructure software industry from 1995-2012, using a hand-collected panel dataset of 121 public firms. The main findings are that spanning structural holes and paying attention to peripheral competitors are positively associated with product innovation. Counter-intuitively, competitor churn has a negative association. The key conclusion is that firms with an 'unusual' view of competition—seeing what others miss by looking to the network's frontiers—are more innovative. The paper's primary contributions are: (1) establishing the strategic importance of perceived competition networks, a novel concept; (2) demonstrating that optimal positioning strategies in competition networks diverge from those in collaboration networks (e.g., brokerage and periphery are beneficial); and (3) introducing and validating the use of 10-K filings to systematically measure managerial perceptions of competition."
