      "L1_summary_of_paper": "This paper provides a comprehensive review of the multimarket competition (MMC) literature. The central research question is to summarize and structure the state of knowledge in this domain. The authors classify the existing research into four broad themes: (1) the antecedents of multimarket contact, exploring whether it arises from deliberate strategy or chance; (2) the outcomes of MMC, primarily focusing on its effects on firm performance and the intensity of rivalry; (3) the contingencies that moderate the core 'mutual forbearance hypothesis'; and (4) extensions of MMC research into new areas like intra-firm competition and factor markets. Key concepts defined include Multimarket Contact (MMC), which is when firms meet in more than one market, and Multimarket Competition, which refers to how MMC affects interfirm rivalry. The central theoretical framing is the mutual forbearance hypothesis, which posits that as firms compete with the same rivals across multiple markets, they become less likely to compete aggressively in any single market for fear of triggering a broader, multi-market retaliation. The review covers constructs like market entry/exit, pricing, and competitive response speed, in contexts ranging from airlines and banking to software and automobiles. The main findings indicate that while there is robust general support for the mutual forbearance hypothesis (i.e., MMC tends to reduce rivalry and improve performance), this relationship is complex and highly contingent on a variety of market-level (e.g., concentration), firm-level (e.g., CEO tenure), and dyad-level (e.g., strategic similarity) factors. The relationship can also be non-linear, such as an inverted U-shape between MMC and market entry. The paper's primary contribution is integrating a large and fragmented body of literature into a coherent framework and identifying promising, specific directions for future inquiry, particularly at the intersection of MMC and corporate strategy, other interorganizational relationships, and a more refined understanding of the mutual forbearance hypothesis itself."

The review highlights the evolution of the field from market-level to dyad-level analysis and synthesizes the numerous contingencies that qualify the MMC-rivalry relationship. Critically, it redirects future research efforts by identifying specific, high-potential avenues for inquiry, particularly at the intersection of competitive and corporate strategy."
