      "L1_summary_of_paper": "This study investigates whether and how a CEO turnover at a focal firm (announcer) creates strategic opportunities for its intra-industry rivals. The core research question is whether rivals can seize these opportunities to gain a competitive advantage. The paper integrates two key theoretical frames: leader life cycle theory, which posits that a new CEO's arrival leads to a 'period of relative stagnation' as they adapt, and competitive dynamics theory, which suggests that fully operational rivals can exploit this temporary vulnerability. The main constructs studied are CEO turnover (distinguishing between forced and routine), the subsequent performance of the announcing firm, and the corresponding performance of a matched portfolio of rival firms. The context is a large sample of 857 CEO turnovers in U.S. publicly listed firms between 1992 and 2002. Using a mixed-methods approach combining event study analysis of stock returns (BHARs), panel data analysis of accounting performance (RoA), semi-structured interviews with executives, and a systematic news search, the study finds strong evidence of a competitive spillover effect. The main finding is that following a CEO turnover, particularly a forced one, announcing firms experience negative abnormal returns while their rivals experience positive abnormal returns, with the performance gap peaking at about 5% around 125 days post-announcement. This is supported by accounting data showing rivals improve their RoA and investment post-turnover. The study's primary contribution is to provide the first large-scale empirical evidence of the intra-industry consequences of CEO turnovers, thereby bridging the literature on leadership succession and competitive dynamics and demonstrating that internal governance events can be a significant source of temporary competitive advantage for rivals."
