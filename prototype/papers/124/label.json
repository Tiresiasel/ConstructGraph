      "L1_summary_of_paper": "This study investigates how different forms of network embeddedness affect the stability of interfirm alliances, specifically focusing on the hazard of unplanned joint venture (JV) dissolution. The core research question is why many alliances fail due to collaboration problems, even when network structures are thought to help firms select better partners initially. The paper distinguishes three key concepts of embeddedness: relational (history of direct ties), positional (network centrality), and structural (common third-party partners). The theoretical framing posits that these forms of embeddedness provide distinct benefits—knowledge-based trust, informational/reputational advantages, and social monitoring, respectively—which have different implications for alliance stability versus formation. The study examines the relationships between partners' combined centrality and positional asymmetry at founding (positional embeddedness), and the evolving number of common partners (structural embeddedness), on the likelihood of JV dissolution. It further explores how these effects are moderated by prior direct ties and the level of competitive risk (positional asymmetry and competitive overlap). The context is the global chemicals industry, analyzing 201 dyadic JVs formed between 1983 and 1991. The main finding is that the effects of embeddedness on dissolution are not a mirror image of their effects on formation. Positional centrality does not promote stability and can even increase dissolution risk when partners already have direct ties. In contrast, structural embeddedness (common partners) significantly enhances stability, particularly in high-risk relationships characterized by positional asymmetry or high competitive overlap. The paper's primary contribution is redirecting network theory by showing that social structure's role shifts from partner selection (formation) to social control and order maintenance (stability), and demonstrating that the stabilizing benefits of embeddedness are most potent precisely when economic incentives for conflict are highest."

Instead, structural embeddedness (common partners) acts as a crucial social control mechanism that maintains order, especially in high-risk relationships. This shifts the theoretical focus from the informational benefits of networks to their role in governance and deterrence post-formation."
