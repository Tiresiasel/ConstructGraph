      "L1_summary_of_paper": "This paper conducts a large-scale replication and extension of Baum and Mezias' (1992) influential single-market study on localized competition. The central research question is whether the negative effects of localized competition on firm survival, originally observed in the Manhattan hotel industry, are generalizable to other urban markets across the United States. The study investigates three key dimensions of localized competition based on similarity in: (1) size (number of rooms), (2) geographic location, and (3) price point. The theoretical framing is rooted in organizational ecology, which posits that competition is most intense among organizations with similar resource requirements. The study analyzes a panel dataset of 23,875 hotels across 90 U.S. urban markets from 2000 to 2014, using exponential hazard models to predict hotel failure. The main findings consistently demonstrate that at the broad market level, a hotel's likelihood of survival decreases as competition from similarly sized, geographically proximate, and similarly priced hotels increases. This supports all three of the original study's hypotheses at the market level, whereas the original study only found support for size-based competition at this level. When analyzing narrower submarket 'windows,' the study finds support for size- and geography-based competition, but not price-based competition, partly attributed to high multicollinearity. The study contributes to the literature by validating the concept of localized competition across a broad and diverse sample, introducing standardized measures of competition that are independent of market size, and examining the phenomenon across key subpopulations (e.g., old vs. new hotels, branded vs. independent), thereby enhancing the generalizability and robustness of the original findings."

The author attempts to mitigate this by analyzing a subsample of older hotels[cite: 440].
