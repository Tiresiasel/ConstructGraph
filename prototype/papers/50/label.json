      "L1_summary_of_paper": "This conceptual paper addresses a critical gap in the competitive dynamics literature: how previously non-rival firms become direct competitors. The authors define this phenomenon as a 'competitive landscape shift,' operationalized as a significant change in market commonality between firms. The core theoretical argument is that Strategic Entrepreneurship (SE)—the integration of advantage-seeking and opportunity-seeking behaviors—is a key firm-level driver of these shifts. The paper proposes a multi-level model where firms engaged in SE are more likely to recognize entrepreneurial opportunities outside their current competitive domains. This relationship is moderated positively by hypercompetition in the current domain and negatively by executives' psychological identification with that domain. The model further posits that the recognition of such opportunities leads to 'radical competitive actions' (e.g., entry into a new market). This step is, in turn, moderated negatively by entry barriers in the new domain and positively by the firm's acumen regarding that new domain. Finally, these radical actions directly cause shifts in market commonality, with the nature of the resulting rivalry (e.g., degree of directness) being moderated by the resource similarity between the focal firm and the incumbents in the new domain. The primary contribution is the development of a coherent, micro-foundational theory that explains the endogenous creation of new competitive relationships, thereby dynamizing the traditional competitor analysis framework and providing a new lens for understanding industry evolution."

Its core achievement is to define, theorize, and offer a testable model for a crucial but understudied phenomenon in modern strategy."
